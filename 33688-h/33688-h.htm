<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h3>A Peep at the Wonder Club.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Towards</span> the close of the last century there
stood in one of the Midland counties of
England, in the centre of two cross-roads, a venerable
hostelry, built in the reign of Elizabeth, and known by
the sign of "Ye Headless Lady." Its ancient gables
were shaded by luxuriant elms and beech trees. The
woodwork of the building and its weather-stained walls
of brick were partially overgrown with thick ivy, while
its high, dingy-red roof was tinted with every variety of
lichen. The windows were narrow, and the framework
heavy, as is usual in houses of that period.</p>

<p>The host of this establishment, one Jack Hearty,
was one of the old school of landlords&mdash;robust, jovial,
and never above his business. His fathers had owned
the inn before him, and "he never wished to be a
better man than his father, nor a worse either, for the
matter of that," as he would say. All day long, when
not engaged with his customers indoors, he was to be
seen at the door of his inn, with his apron girt around
him, and a "yard of clay" at his lips, straining his eyes
down the long cross-roads for the first glimpse of a
customer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Often after gazing long and intently into the distance
he would turn back with a sigh, knock the ashes from
his pipe, refill it, take a deep draught of his own home-brewed
ale, then, if none of his customers required
anything, and the affairs of his household permitted it,
he would sally out again. This time, perhaps, his eyes
would be greeted by the sight of a solitary wayfarer, or,
better still, the stage-coach. Then it was that the
honest landlord's face would brighten up, as it was
certain to bring him some of the "big-wigs" from
town. He would rub his hands and chuckle, while
Dame Hearty would begin to bustle about to welcome
the fresh arrivals. It was not often, however, that the
"Headless Lady" was entirely deserted.</p>

<p>A small clique or brotherhood, known as "The
Wonder Club," had been nightly in the habit of
assembling here for years, and this served to bring grist
to the mill. Some of the eminent men from the
neighbouring village, among whom were the doctor,
the lawyer, an antiquary, an analytical chemist, and
others, had formed among themselves a club, which
was to consist only of very choice spirits, like themselves,
and if any guest were introduced among them,
it was only to be with a letter of introduction and the
full consent of all parties. By these strict rules they
hoped to keep the club select. A room at the inn
was set apart for them, into which no one not belonging
to the club ever presumed to enter, unless it was the
landlord, who would be called every now and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
replenish the bowl, and whom sometimes the guests
of the club would "draw out," as it was whispered in
the village that the landlord of the "Headless Lady"
knew a rare lot of stories, he did; also how to tell
'em, too, my word! but these he generally reserved
for his more intimate customers. One strict law of the
club that we have not yet mentioned was that no
guest invited was to be a "business man." Should a
commercial traveller ever have the hardihood to enter
the sacred precincts of the club, he was assailed with a
battery of glances from the members that must have
completely cowed him, unless he were a man of more
than usual strength of nerve; but as this rarely
happened, all such outward manifestations of contempt
were kept within due bounds. Business was, of course,
tabooed; even politics were only admitted on sufferance
and by a special permission of the chairman. There
was one evening in the year, however, when the chairman
never granted any such permission, and that was
on the anniversary of the founding of the club. On
this evening such subjects as business and politics
would have been cried down, and the daring introducer
of the obnoxious themes would have been condemned
to drink a cup of cold water on his bended knees by
way of expiating his offence. No subjects of public or
private interest were tolerated on this evening, or, indeed,
on any other. The chief delight of this club was to
tell or to listen to stories which were all more or less
of the marvellous class, and which each took it by turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to relate to the rest, the strictest silence and order
being preserved during the recital. The evening that
we are about to describe to the reader was the tenth
anniversary of the founding of the club. This was a
very grand event. For any one of its members or
guests, whether married or single, to have been absent,
on this occasion would have been little less than an
insult to the rest. Let us try to give our readers a
glimpse of the club room and its guests on this
memorable evening.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, a large room with low ceiling and
walls of dark oak panel, a large old-fashioned fireplace
with dogs, and a Yule log blazing on the hearth. The
curtains are old and embroidered, and closely drawn.
The room is well lighted, and in the middle is a long
table, at which, through a cloud of tobacco smoke, a
party of nine&mdash;all lords of the creation&mdash;may be
discovered. A bowl of punch is in the centre of the
table, at which every now and then each guest
replenishes his glass. Mr. Oldstone, the antiquary,
has been elected chairman. Watch with what dignity
he fills his post of honour. Look! he rises and thumps
the table. He is going to make a speech. The
strictest silence reigns; you might hear a pin drop.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," began the worthy chairman, after
one or two preliminary "hems," "it is with feelings
of mixed pride and pleasure that I feel myself called
upon to-night to preside at this most honourable
meeting." (Hear, hear!) The chairman resumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"This is the tenth anniversary of our club of choice
spirits (cheers), and so shamefully nicknamed by our
enemies 'The Morbid Club.' (Groans.) Irritated at our
exclusiveness, and envious at the reports of the superior
talent that circulates nightly at our table, and which
bursts into a halo of genius on our great saturnalias,
what wonder, gentlemen, if the worthy members of
our select club should make enemies out of their own
circle? Only 'birds of a feather flock together,' and
perhaps the contempt of our enemies is the best
compliment they can pay us." (Hear, hear! and
various shouts and yells of delight, amid clapping of
hands, stamping, and rattling of glasses.) Here the
chairman paused to take breath, and then, after a
preliminary sip at his glass of punch, proceeded.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I feel duly sensible of the honour
conferred upon me this evening in being selected to
preside at our meeting on this very important occasion,
an honour which I feel unable to support, and for
which I feel my abilities so inadequate. (No, no!)
Gentlemen, we are a company of nine this evening,
the number of the muses&mdash;the omen is auspicious.
I see around me faces that were present at the
inauguration of our club, ten years ago, though others,
alas! have gone to their long rest." Here the speaker
was visibly moved, and passed his hand over his eyes
to wipe away an incipient tear. Then, recovering
himself, "Need I proceed, gentlemen? Need I trespass
longer upon the time and patience of guests so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
illustrious? (Yes, yes!) Then, gentlemen," continued
the speaker, "I would but detain you one moment
longer, to propose the following toast, to be drunk with
three times three. (Hear, hear!) 'Long live the
"Wonder Club," and all its choice members.'" Here
the president, at the conclusion of his speech, held a
bumper above his head, and repeated the toast with the
rest of the company, with a "Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!"
"May their brains be as fertile as the plains of
Elysium, and may the fame of the 'Wonder Club'
spread to the ends of the earth." This sentiment was
followed by a burst of applause.</p>

<p>In the midst of the stamping, cheering, and rattling
of glasses that ensued a knock was heard at the door.
Who could it be? The landlord? It was not his wont
to disturb the club for a trifle. He only made his
appearance when called for. What was it? Was the
inn on fire? Who could venture to disturb the solemn
meeting of the "Wonder Club" on their tenth anniversary?
One of the members rose from his seat and
opened the door ajar, still holding the handle in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Who is it? What do you want at this hour?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, gentlemen," said the voice of the
honest landlord without, "for disturbing the company;
but a gentleman has just brought a letter for the chairman,
and I thought it <i>might</i> be important. Leastways,
I thought it wouldn't be much harm to deliver it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
once. The gentleman has sent in his card. Excuse the
interruption, sirs; I hope no offence."</p>

<p>The letter was delivered to Mr. Oldstone. He
glanced at the card.</p>

<p>"What, a visitor!" he said; "and at this time of
night. Let me tell you, landlord&mdash;ahem&mdash;that this is a
most unwarrantable infringement of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;of the
rules laid down by&mdash;er&mdash;eh? Stay, what have we here?
Excuse me, gentlemen, while I break the seal. Ha!
from my old friend Rustcoin. You remember him,
gentlemen&mdash;my brother antiquary, formerly a member
of our club. He writes from Rome:</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I dare say you are surprised
to hear from me again, after my long silence. The fact
is that I had put off writing to you, having some time
ago formed a resolution of returning to England, when
I hoped to surprise you by suddenly appearing unexpectedly
in time for the tenth anniversary of the inauguration
of our club. Certain affairs, however, have
prevented me from being present myself in the flesh,
but I beg to introduce to your notice my young friend,
Mr. Vandyke McGuilp, an artist who has for some
time past been prosecuting his studies here in Rome.
He is a young man of talent and genius, possessing
a great fund of stories of the marvellous and supernatural
order, such as your club particularly prides
itself on. He is quite one of our sort, and you
would be doing me a great favour to introduce him
to the rest of the members. If he could arrive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
time for your grand saturnalia, I should be doubly
pleased.&mdash;Your old friend,</p>

<p class="rgt">"'<span class="smcap">Charles Rustcoin.</span>'"</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the president, "what do
you say to that? Shall the neophyte be admitted?
You see, he is not a commercial traveller, nor a business
man, but an artist; one of those restless strivers after
the ideal. A traveller, too&mdash;a man full of stories, like
one of us. What do you say&mdash;shall he be admitted?"</p>

<p>The guests gave an unanimous consent, and the
next moment our host ushered the stranger into the
club-room. All eyes were directed towards the stranger.
He was a young man, bordering on thirty, about the
middle height, who, contrary to the custom of the
period, wore his own hair, which at that time was considered
extremely vulgar. He wore a slouch hat instead
of the usual three-cornered shape, and an Italian cloak
thrown over the left shoulder.</p>

<p>He doffed his hat with dignity and courtesy as he
entered the apartment, and after shaking the snow from
his cloak (for it had been snowing hard without that
night, being in December), he handed cloak and hat to
the landlord and accepted the offer of a chair that Mr.
Oldstone had placed for him near the fire.</p>

<p>"Here! mine host," shouted Mr. Oldstone, "bring
another log, and see that you make this gentleman
comfortable to-night, for I see without asking him any
questions that he is one of our set."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said the landlord, who was just leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the room. "Never fear, sir, I'll see to the gentleman's
wants, and my old woman will warm the bed, for
it's a nasty night to be out in. My blessed eyes, how it
snows! The gentleman must have had pressing business
with you, sir, to bring him out here such a night as
this."</p>

<p>"No, my good host," replied the artist; "nothing
more than a desire to be present at the tenth anniversary
of the club that I have heard so much about."</p>

<p>The host looked astonished, and the guests felt
flattered. The landlord's respect for the members of
the club was augmented considerably.</p>

<p>"Well, well; to think of that, now," he muttered to
himself. "To think that this gentleman should trouble
himself to come from who knows how far off, just to be
present at the tenth anniversary of <i>our</i> club, and on
such a night as this, too."</p>

<p>"By the by, Mr. Hearty," said the new comer to the
landlord: "I believe that's your name, is it not?"</p>

<p>"The same, sir; Jack Hearty, at your service, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jack Hearty, I have just come from
foreign parts, where I have left an old customer of
yours; one Mr. Rustcoin, a great friend of Mr. Oldstone's.
Do you recollect him?"</p>

<p>"<i>Recollect</i> him!" exclaimed the landlord. "Ay,
indeed, sir, do I; a pleasanter gentleman over his bottle
of port or over his bowl of punch hasn't crossed my
threshold since he left it. Many's the good yarn we
would have together. I hope you left him very well, sir?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"In excellent health, thank you, Jack," said the
stranger. "He desired to be remembered to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the host.</p>

<p>"Yes; those slippers will do," said the new guest.</p>

<p>"Draw near to the table, my friend," said Mr.
Oldstone, "for I must introduce you to the other
members and guests here to-night."</p>

<p>"My friends," said the chairman, "this gentleman is
Mr. Vandyke McGuilp, an artist from Rome, great
friend of my old chum Rustcoin, whom most of you
knew. Mr. McGuilp, this gentleman on my right is
Mr. Hardcase, the lawyer, who will be the first to
relate a story to-night. On his right is Dr. Bleedem,
one of our celebrated physicians; next to him is
Mr. Cyanite, professor of geology, and then comes
Mr. Blackdeed, one of our eminent tragedians; next
to him is Mr. Parnassus, a young poet of great
promise; after him is Mr. Crucible, analytical chemist,
one of the oldest members of our club; next to him, as
guest to-night, is Captain Toughyarn, commander of
Her Majesty's good ship the <i>Dreadnought</i>; then, next
door neighbour to yourself is Mr. Jollytoast, celebrated
low comedian."</p>

<p>The new visitor bowed to each guest at the table with
urbanity, and the guests returned the salute cordially.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," began the president, "what
do you say to a bumper to the health of our new
guest?"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried the guests, unanimously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Each filled up his glass from the punch-bowl, and
our artist's health was drunk with cheers, to which he
responded in a short and modest speech. (Applause.)</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Hardcase," said the chairman, after
the formalities were gone through, "I think it was
arranged that you should tell the first story. I hope
you have one ready. I am anxious for my young friend
to hear a specimen of our far-famed recitals. In this
club," said Mr. Oldstone, addressing the artist, "we
always esteem those stories the highest that are true,
and especially if they are facts coming under the experience
of the relater. What sort of story may we expect
from you to-night, Mr. Hardcase?"</p>

<p>"The story I intended to start the club with to-night
is one that I myself took part in in my younger days,
and which, although I never related to any of the club
before, I have been upon the point of relating a
hundred times, when I have been invariably interrupted
by someone else who had some other tale to relate.
The story I have in store for you this evening, gentlemen,
I propose to entitle 'The Phantom Flea.'"</p>

<p>"Ha, Bravo!" laughed the guests. "The Phantom
Flea! Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"I assure you, gentlemen," said the lawyer, gravely,
"that the narrative I am about to relate is not one
to provoke mirth. It is of a solemn character, I can
promise you. No one felt less inclined to laugh than I
did when I was reluctantly compelled to take part in
this tragedy. Though by no means a timid man, I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
nevertheless, experienced a sort of cold shiver all down
my back when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"And each particular hair to stand on end like
quills upon the fretful porcupine," quoted Mr.
Blackdeed, the tragedian.</p>

<p>"Belay that," roared Captain Toughyarn, from the
depths of his stentorian lungs, "and make room on
board for the 'Phantom Flea.'"</p>

<p>"Bedad, and sure I feel myself itching all over
alriddy," broke in Mr. Jollytoast, assuming an Irish
brogue, and scratching himself.</p>

<p>"Order, order! Chair, chair!" called out other
guests.</p>

<p>"Silence! gentlemen," said Mr. Oldstone, with
authority, thumping on the table; "the story is just
about to commence."</p>

<p>"The performance is just a-goin' to begin," broke
in the incorrigible little comedian, assuming the air of a
showman. "Valk up, valk up, ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Hush! Mr. Jollytoast," said the antiquary.
"Hush! gentlemen, for the 'Phantom Flea.'"</p>

<p>"Tremulous music, lights half down," muttered the
tragedian; but he was instantly silenced by the chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone gave one final authoritative thump on
the table, and glanced severely at all the guests. The
silence that ensued was awful, while Mr. Hardcase,
after a sip at his glass and a puff at his long churchwarden,
began his story in the following manner:</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">One</span> morning, many years ago, whilst sitting idly
in my chambers in town, I received a letter
from Baron &mdash;&mdash; to come down for a few days to his

and Visionary</i>. (<i>Quoted from memory.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Having heard much of my abilities, as he said, he
thought he could not do better than write to me at
once. He regretted that business would prevent him
from being at the Hall on my arrival, but he hoped to
return home some time the next day. In the meantime
he had told his housekeeper to make up a bed for
me at the Hall, and had left open his bookcase, lest the
time might hang heavy on my hands.</p>

<p>Glad of an excuse to leave town, as it was getting
very hot and I had nothing to do, I took the stage,
and towards the middle of the next day found myself
in front of the Baron's country seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a fine, stately mansion, surrounded by a
moat. I crossed the drawbridge, and inquired whether
the Baron was at home. A respectable matron answered
the door. She replied in the negative to my question.</p>

<p>Then, asking if I were Mr. Hardcase, the lawyer,
and learning that I was, she said "The Baron left word
that he would be at home some time to-morrow, or the
day after for certain; that in the meantime you were to
make yourself quite at home, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said I; "I am rather tired just at
present. Leave me here among the Baron's books.
When I have sufficiently rested I should like to look
over the house. It seems a curious old place."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it is a <i>very</i> old place," said the housekeeper.
"But wouldn't you like to take a little refreshment
first?"</p>

<p>Being then past one o'clock, and having had but
a hurried breakfast, I thanked her and said I thought
I could manage a little light refreshment. She then
left me alone, but soon returned with a tray containing
what seemed to be the fag end of a sumptuous
banquet. There was venison pasty, a boiled leg of
turkey, some ham, vegetables, bread and cheese, salad,
raspberry and currant tart, a bottle of good old crusted
port, some sherry, Burgundy, etc.</p>

<p>Having done justice to this light repast, I rang the
bell for the things to be cleared away; after which I
took down a great number of volumes from the bookcase,
and throwing myself into an easy-chair, I deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the books in a heap upon the floor, and began
examining their titles, and occasionally reading a
passage here and there when it interested me.</p>

<p>The first book I laid hands on was "Fox's Book of
Martyrs," with plates showing the various modes of
torture by which the early Christians were put to death.
I passed on to the next. This was a book of Chinese
punishments, with Chinese illustrations. I opened the
book at a plate of a man being skinned alive.</p>

<p>Having little taste for these sort of horrors, I closed
the book and passed on to the next. The third book
was a description of celebrated executions, with a plate
as frontispiece of a man being hanged, drawn, and
quartered. "The Baron seems fond of the horrible,"
I thought, and I took up another. This was on bull-baiting,
cock-fighting, and other cruel sports. Another
was a book on poisons. A sixth, on the various modes
of self-defence. A seventh, a book on field sports. I
put down the book for a moment and sat musing, trying
to imagine to myself what manner of man the Baron
might be. I gazed round the room, and noticed that
it was hung round by trophies of the chase&mdash;stags'
antlers, foxes' brushes, intermingled with guns, powder-flasks,
etc. Here and there were hung half suits of
armour, belonging, no doubt, to the Baron's ancestors.</p>

<p>Then, from musing I fell into a dose, and dreamed
of the wild hunter and all sorts of curious and horrible
things.</p>

<p>On awaking I reflected that I had not been over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the house, so I went in search of the housekeeper, who
asked me if I would like to see the picture gallery.
Nothing loth, I followed my guide, who pointed me out
the portraits of the present Baron's ancestors for I know
not how many generations back.</p>

<p>The portrait of the present Baron was not amongst
them. I noticed a strong family likeness running
through all of the portraits, and I wondered if the
Baron inherited the likeness. I asked the housekeeper,
and she assured me that he did in a very striking
degree. On leaving the gallery, I passed through long
oaken corridors, through immense chambers hung with
tapestry, on which were depicted either battles or
scenes of the chase.</p>

<p>"The Baron inherits the tastes of his ancestors, it
would appear," I said to the matron.</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," said she, with a sigh, and tried to force
a smile, but it was a bitter one.</p>

<p>I took little notice of her expression at the time,
and soon after left her, to stroll about in the garden.
It was a spacious one, laid out in good taste. There
were terraces, broad velvet lawns, cedars of Lebanon,
avenues of yew trees, glimpses of distant hills, flower
beds, luxuriant with every variety of the choicest
flowers. There were broad walks and serpentine
paths, oaks, beeches, elms; a lake with an island
in the middle, which was reached by a rustic bridge;
weeping-willows, summer-houses, and everything that
could be desired. I strolled about the garden, struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with admiration every step I took at the exquisite
taste with which everything was carried out, and
wondered how it was that the same mind which took
such delight in the horrible should possess such
exquisite refinement of taste in the planning of his
garden.</p>

<p>I doubted the garden being the result of the Baron's
own taste, nor was I mistaken, as I afterwards ascertained
from the housekeeper. I strolled back towards
the house, which I examined carefully over for the
second time, then strolled out again into the garden, and
so on till supper, which I took about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Feeling rather lonely, I invited Mrs. Wharton, the
housekeeper, to keep me company during my solitary
meal. She sat down opposite to me as I commenced
devouring my cold fowl and tongue, and helped myself
to a glass of the Baron's ale. She was an agreeable
old lady, and seemed to have known better days.</p>

<p>"This is a curious old place," I began. "Have you
any rats here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, none now," answered the matron.</p>

<p>"Nor bugs?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor fleas?"</p>

<p>"No, sir,&mdash;that is to say, only one," and her face
assumed a solemn expression.</p>

<p>"Only <i>one</i>!" I exclaimed, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said she, gravely&mdash;"only the <i>Phantom</i>;
only the <i>Baron</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Phantom! Baron!</i>" I exclaimed, bewildered.
"Ah, you have a ghost story in the family, I see; but I
don't think you quite understood my question," I
said. "I did not inquire about phantoms, or barons;
my question referred simply to fleas."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I perfectly understand, sir," replied the
matron; "and I repeat that the <i>phantom flea</i> is the
only flea that inhabits this mansion."</p>

<p>"<i>The Phantom Flea!</i>" Here I exploded. "Well,
of all the odd superstitions I ever heard of, that
beats them all. Really, my good woman, you should
<i>not</i>&mdash;you should not, indeed, believe in such trash."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," replied the matron, "it is plain to see
that you are a stranger in these parts. Is it possible
you have never heard of the 'Baron's flea?'"</p>

<p>"Never in all my life before, I assure you, my good
woman," I replied; "but, as it is a thing apparently well
known, I should like to hear the particulars of the
case."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," began the housekeeper, "you must know
that some two hundred years or so back one of the
Baron's ancestors, one Sir Ralph &mdash;&mdash; inhabited this
mansion. The room that you will sleep in to-night was
his room; the self same bed and furniture that you saw
this morning were there in his time. He was not a
man generally liked by those around him; in fact, it
would not be too much to say that he was universally
hated. No one could remember any good act or kind
word of the Baron's. He was cruel, bloodthirsty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
tyrannical, avaricious, ambitious, and sensual. From
early youth he was always allowed to have his own way,
and when he came into power he was the scourge of
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"There was no restraining his cruelty and malignity.
Anyone who dared oppose himself to his will was put
to death. He thought no more of taking the life of
a peasant than one would in wringing the neck of a
fowl. Maidens were carried off with impunity, and
sometimes murdered; men were found stabbed or
mangled to death by the Baron's hounds; cottages
were set fire to, and their inhabitants driven out to seek
refuge where they could; robberies were committed,
churches pillaged, convents sacked, monks driven out
and occasionally burnt alive for pastime; nuns carried
off by ruffians to the Baron's hall; in short, every
species of outrage and plunder conceivable. Such a
state of affairs could not endure for ever. It gave rise
to a rebellion. The long-oppressed people would suffer
it no longer, and rose to a man. They would fain have
broken into the Baron's hall, and have torn him limb
from limb; but the Baron's myrmidons were powerful
and well armed; and, cutting their way through the
crowd with the Baron at their head, spared neither
man, woman, nor child.</p>

<p>"The mob, driven back, were subdued for a time;
but the law interfered, though with little better success;
for the first time that constables were sent to arrest the
Baron, he sent them back again to those who sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with their noses and ears slit. Such an insult as this
against the servants of the law could not be stood
any longer. Grand preparations were made for the
immediate arrest of the Baron and his ruffians, with an
order to raze his castle to the ground, which would
most assuredly have been carried into effect, had not
the sudden death of the Baron rendered such measures
unnecessary.</p>

<p>"The Baron's death was mysterious. Some say
he made away with himself, rather than fall into the
hands of justice. Others assert that he was struck by
lightning as a punishment for his many crimes. Others,
that he was killed in a fray. But the story most current
is, that a man introduced himself into the Baron's
household as servant, whose bride the Baron had dishonoured,
and avenged himself by putting an end to the
Baron's life by poison.</p>

<p>"However this was, testimony goes much to prove
that the Baron was found dead in his bed. How long
he took dying is uncertain, but tradition tells that his
last moments were horrible. He refused to see a
father confessor, and died in his sins.</p>

<p>"He was succeeded by his son, a peaceful and
studious youth, much beloved by the people, who did
not seem to inherit a drop of the old Baron's blood.
In some of his later descendants, however, the spirit of
the old Baron seemed to reign again. When the death
of the Baron was made known, great rejoicings manifested
themselves in the neighbourhood. Everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wanted to know the particulars of the Baron's mysterious
end. Strange stories were set afloat, many of which
are believed to this day. But one thing universally
believed is, that, as a punishment for his sins, the
Baron's spirit is condemned to inhabit the form of a
flea of uncommon size, which sucks the blood of all
strangers who sleep in that bed. His power, however,
is confined to that chamber. Other rooms are left
unmolested. The marks left on the body by the bite
of this fell insect are extremely large, being about the
size of a wen, and the pain endures for a considerable
time. I can speak from experience, for I have been
bitten myself. The flea may be seen by anyone who
chooses to sleep in that room. One night spent in
that chamber will be enough to convince any unbeliever
of the truth of my assertion.</p>

<p>"Many and futile have been the attempts to catch
this obnoxious insect. It eludes all chase. It was not
for many years after the Baron's death, and until many
of the occupants of that chamber had been repeatedly
bitten, and all attempts to capture the offensive creature
had been abandoned in despair, that the belief that the
Baron's spirit inhabited its fell body grew firmly rooted
in the minds of the surrounding gentry.</p>

<p>"If, after what I have related to you, sir, you feel
inclined to change your room, I shall have much
pleasure in making you up a bed in another chamber,
although it is against the Baron's orders; for, knowing
what a wretched night you <i>must</i> spend within that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
haunted chamber, I feel a compassion for you, sir, and
all strangers that the Baron cruelly hands over to the
spirit of his wicked ancestor."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mrs. Wharton," I said, "I have
the greatest curiosity to encounter this wonderful flea.
Your conversation has been most interesting, and as it
is now past ten o'clock, I don't care how soon I make
his aristocratic acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Do as you please, sir," said Mrs. Wharton, "but
if you should feel uncomfortable in the night, you've
but to knock at my door, the next room to yours, and
I will gladly make you up a bed in No. 12."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mrs. Wharton; I am much
obliged to you all the same. I have no doubt that
the Baron and I will be capital friends."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I wish you a pleasant night of it, I am
sure," said the housekeeper, as she handed me a
candle. "Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mrs. Wharton."</p>

<p>I walked up stairs to the haunted chamber. Having
reached the landing, I entered my room and locked
myself in for the night. In spite of my forced levity,
I must admit that I felt a certain feeling of awe come
over me upon entering the chamber once occupied by
the author of so many crimes. I could not but think
that Mrs. Wharton herself thoroughly believed in what
seemed to me a popular superstition, but the more I
reflected on what she had told me of the Baron's
crimes, the less ludicrous did the idea of the Baron's
metempsychosis appear to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>What, after all, was there ridiculous in a flea more
than in any other hideous creature? The feeling of
the ludicrous in my mind was supplanted by one
of horror. "There are more things in heaven and
earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy," I
muttered. I could not make up my mind to go to rest
immediately. In fact, I did not feel in the least
sleepy. I busied myself in examining the room
minutely to see if there were any trap-door or sliding
panel; and, tapping all the walls, expected every
moment to touch some spring and for some panel to fly
back, discovering a secret staircase. I examined the bed
and under the bed, but could discover nothing. The
Baron's portrait hung over the mantelpiece. I lifted
up the picture to see if there was any hole in the wall
underneath, but there was nothing but good solid
panel; nor could I in any part of the room discover
anything suspicious. I partially undressed and seated
myself in a large arm-chair in front of the Baron's
portrait. I was extremely interested in the perusal
of his features, and had no difficulty in believing all
the atrocities attributed to the original. The more I
gazed at it, the more it fascinated me. I could not
take my eyes from it. Somehow or other the features
seemed familiar to me; I fancied I had seen them
somewhere. I tried to collect my thoughts. Where
had I seen them before?</p>

<p>Suddenly I recollected a horrible criminal, who
had murdered a whole family and committed other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
heinous atrocities, and had been executed a year
or two before. I had to plead for him at the trial, but
the evidence was so strong against him, that no earthly
power could save him from the gibbet. The likeness
between this wretch and the portrait before me was
very remarkable. This, then, was the incarnation of
deep crime. These are the features that mark a life
given up to every sort of cruelty, licentiousness, and
depravity. The physiognomy was peculiar, and never
to be forgotten when once seen. The head was round
as a bullet, the hair red, short and bristly, the
moustache and peaked beard of the same hue; the
eyes greenish, and obliquely set in the head, like those
of a cat, with an expression of the most indescribable
ferocity and malice. The eyebrows red and tufted,
running up also in an oblique direction, one of them
being considerably higher than the other. Between
the brows was a deep line. The forehead was flat,
and retired from the temples in two separate peaks,
that appeared to run up nearly to the back of his head;
the nose was at once hooked and flat, like the bill of
a parrot; the mouth was wide; the lips thin and
compressed, with unpleasant lines at the corners; the
chin and jaw square and massive; the neck resembling
that of a bull; the ears were unusually large, and
stuck out at the sides; the complexion was florid,
with two pouches under the eyes, which seemed to
drag the eyes down and give them a bloodshot
appearance. A deep line in the cheeks, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
from each wing of the nose to the corners of the mouth,
gave to the countenance a look of cynical disdain,
and completed a portrait at once characteristic and
revolting. The costume was early Elizabethan, and
the arms of the Baron, together with his name and his
age&mdash;forty-six&mdash;when the portrait was taken, were
depicted with the date in the corner of the picture.
For a while I sat musing. "Fit spirit," I muttered,
"to inhabit the form of a flea! Heartless, worthless,
bloodthirsty." I gazed at the portrait with feelings of
horror and disgust. The eyes seemed to answer my
expression with a look of anger.</p>

<p>I was unable to judge of the merits of the picture
as a work of art, being little versed in such matters;
but of one thing I am certain, that the painter had
endeavoured to imitate as truthfully as it lay in his
power all the leading characteristics of the Baron's
physiognomy without any attempt at flattery.</p>

<p>As I mused it grew late; it was now just upon midnight.
I finished undressing and climbed into my bed,
a high old-fashioned four-poster with heavy embroidered
curtains. The Baron still scowled at me from the
mantelpiece, but, without returning his gaze, I set to
work diligently to search for the flea. I drew back the
top sheet slowly until the whole bed was uncovered. I
shook the blankets and counterpane and looked under
the pillow, but all in vain, not a glimpse of a flea was
visible. It was a clean, well-aired bed, so, feeling now
rather sleepy, I covered myself up with the bed-clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and blew out the light, with every prospect of a good
night's rest before me. But, alas! how soon was I
undeceived. Hardly had I gone off into my first sleep,
when I was suddenly awoke from a delicious dream
with a sharp, sudden pang, like a stab or the tooth
of some venomous reptile in the fleshy part of my
thigh. I started up in horror, hardly able to restrain a
slight shriek. The night was dark and stormy, the
winds howled without, and the old mansion shook from
its foundations. "The Phantom Flea!" I muttered,
horrified, and reached out my hand for my tinder-box;
but before I was able to strike a light, I experienced a
second sharp stinging pain in the small of the back,
then another in the calf of my leg. By this time I had
succeeded in striking a light. Some scorpion, I thought.
So, lighting my candle, I commenced a rigid search.</p>

<p>At length I caught sight of the vile insect. There
it was, sure enough, a flea, and no mistake about it, but
what a monster! It must have been the size of a
coffee bean. What legs! How it hopped from one
side of the bed to the other!</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, I used my utmost endeavours to
capture it; and here let me add that I am generally
rather expert at that sort of game, having had some
practice in my time; but, would you believe it, gentlemen,
it foiled all my best endeavours, although I kept
it in sight all the time. I was a full hour and a half
engaged in this undignified chase. The "Phantom
Flea" defied me to the last. What was I to do? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
couldn't sit up all night hunting a flea, and yet to get
any sleep with such a monster in the bed was equally
impossible. Suddenly I recollected that I had a small
bottle of opium in my waistcoat pocket, which I had
purchased the day before to relieve a toothache that
I had caught from sitting in the theatre at one end of
a row of stalls, close to the door, which kept continually
opening and shutting. I rose and searched for the
bottle, and swallowed more, perhaps, than under
ordinary circumstances would have been good for me,
got into bed again, and blew out the light. The first
sensation I experienced was that of a deliciously
gradual dropping off to sleep, but the keenness of my
senses was increased a hundred-fold. My memory and
my imagination bordered on the abnormal. Every
event in my life, from the cradle up to the present
moment, rose before my mind in microscopic detail.</p>

<p>The room was dark; nevertheless, my eye, grown
accustomed to the light, and sharpened by the effects
of the opium, enabled me to discover every object in
the room distinctly. There was the bed, the counterpane,
every little tuft worked on it with painful distinctness.
There was the texture of the sheets; every fibre
of the blankets, and last, but not least, the "Phantom
Flea" hopping about and around me, and biting me
here and there at his pleasure. The opium in some
measure relieved the severity of the bite, though the
latter was still painful enough to prevent me from going
off to sleep altogether. The sensation of delirium (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
I can call it nothing else) caused by the opium seemed
to increase. The room appeared to grow lighter and
lighter, till it seemed to glow with a phosphoric glare.</p>

<p>My sight, hearing, and other senses grew rapidly
more and more acute. Everything around me seemed
to swell and dilate into proportions positively enormous.
I felt myself grow larger, the bed grew larger, the room
grew larger, the picture grew larger, and the <i>flea</i> grew
larger. Larger and larger swelled the bed; larger, <i>larger</i>,
and ever larger grew the flea, till it attained the proportions
of a horse. I noticed that the larger it grew,
the less like a flea and more human it became. At
length it appeared to stop growing, and to decrease, if
anything. It had now assumed the size of a man, and
a form almost human. There it stood at the foot of my
bed, with its arms folded on its breast, and its eye
steadily fixed upon mine. How shall I describe the
horror of my situation&mdash;feeling my eyes rivetted on
that hideous face with a preternatural fascination? To
remove them was impossible. Yet to gaze on it further
was death. I can describe my feelings to nothing else
than the sensation of gradually turning into stone. I felt
life fast ebbing from me. My head whirled, I gasped
for breath. I tried to speak, to implore for mercy, but
my voice was gone. I felt my last moment had come.</p>

<p>The remorseless flea seemed conscious of my agony,
and gloated on my sufferings, for he never took his
stony eye off me all the while. Unable to move, and
bathed in a profuse perspiration, I must have died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
another instant from sheer agony and terror, had I not
by a supernatural effort gathered up my last dying
energies, and burst out in a loud, despairing yell that
seemed to pierce the walls of the whole house. I felt
the spell broken for the time. The fiend himself
seemed startled by the sudden and preternatural shrillness
of the scream, and for a moment changed the
expression of his countenance. Feeling his eye no
longer fixed upon mine with that fearful intensity, I
dared to breathe again; but I had awoke Mrs. Wharton
in the next room, and she knocked at my door to ask
me what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you," I said; "only a dream; don't
be alarmed."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Wharton retired to her room again.</p>

<p>The monster who had never left me during all this
time, at length spoke.</p>

<p>"I have summoned you here to-night, because
I have need of you. I am that Baron Ralph, the
ruthless, whose deeds of bloodshed you have already
heard of, and for which deeds he is condemned
nightly to inhabit the form of a flea. You have
experienced my power, and your paltry scepticism has
been shaken. Listen now to me. I do not always
inhabit the contemptible form in which you first saw
me. In the daytime I wander to and fro on the earth,
and inhabit by turns the bodies of such men whose
natural propensities are in harmony with my own.
Wretch! do you know that the man, who, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
your inability to save, was executed for some few
paltry murders, was none other than myself in the
flesh? That it was <i>my</i> body that suffered the pain and
disgrace of execution, <i>my</i> spirit that was driven back by
your incapacity, to inhabit the form of one of the
vilest of insects? Think not to escape my resentment.
I have need of you again, it is true, but I do not ask
you a favour, I command you to obey. Spirits of my
order do not ask; they command and threaten, and if
disobeyed, punish."</p>

<p>Aware of the awful power of this fell being and
knowing all resistance vain, I thought it best to assume
as humble a position as I could, in order to milden
the severity of his look and manner&mdash;that fearful look
that I had experienced only a few minutes ago, and
which might kill me outright a second time. Therefore
I prostrated myself before him on the bed, and in the
most abject tones began.</p>

<p>"Illustrious flea! I will do all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Irreverent varlet!" exclaimed the Baron, fiercely,
darting at me a glance from his evil eye that froze my
very marrow. "That name is offensive to me, another
such title as that, and I'll&mdash;I'll"&mdash;here the Baron's face
went through the most hideously savage contortions
that it is possible to imagine. The Baron's portrait
taken in the flesh was ugly enough, but it was an ideal
of manly beauty compared with the infernal aspect of
this demon flea before me.</p>

<p>"Mercy! mercy!" cried I, gasping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, 'Mercy, mercy,'" retorted the Baron, with
a sneer. "Very well, then, this time, but mind&mdash;&mdash;"
Here his countenance again assumed a ferocious
expression. "Ha! ha!" he cried. "You thought to
outwit me by taking opium to deaden my bite. Fool!
know it was <i>I</i> who made you buy that opium; not to
make you <i>sleep</i>, but to <i>awaken</i> your dull senses to such a
pitch that the gross material clay that clogs your vision
might be, as it were, doffed for a moment, and that your
keener eyesight might be able to grasp my form a
degree nearer resembling that which I bore in the flesh,
thereby in a measure removing the barrier between our
beings; and each, as it were, meeting on neutral
ground, to the end that you should know my pleasure
and obey my commands. It was I who caused you to
catch that toothache, by inspiring you to go to the
theatre. It was I who so ordained the distribution of
the tickets that that ticket near the door should fall
to your lot, where I knew you would take cold in the
tooth, being subject to the toothache. I then, by my
subtle arts, caused you to buy that bottle of opium
and bring it here with you. I then worried you by
continual biting, till I forced you to seek comfort in
that opium bottle, and now that your usually obtuse
senses are raised to that abnormal state necessary to
converse with beings of my order, listen, and give
ear to what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Awful being, say on," I muttered.</p>

<p>"You must know, then," he continued, "that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
spirit inhabits by day the body of the present Baron
who bears my name, though at night I am compelled
to assume the ignoble shape of a flea. At this present
moment my descendant lies in his bed lifeless. My
spirit will animate his clay to-morrow. Call upon him
early, and you will learn from him what I have not time
to discuss with you now, as it is now daybreak and my
power is on the wane. Farewell."</p>

<p>So saying, he gradually decreased in size, losing
every moment more and more of the <i>human</i> element
that he had assumed, and growing more and more into
the likeness of a flea the smaller he grew, till he
returned to the size he appeared when I first saw him,
and then vanished mysteriously. The exciting effects
of the opium had worn off, but they had given place to
a feeling of deep depression. My head felt too heavy
for me, and ached terribly; my eyeballs were as if
weighed down by lead. I could not sleep comfortably,
and I was too lazy to get up. I loathed my own existence,
and hated everybody and everything around me.
Thoughts of suicide haunted me, and I had a momentary
thought of emptying the whole of the remaining contents
of the bottle down my throat, and so put an end
to my misery for ever. But then I bethought me
of the Baron; it might be the means of invoking
again the "Phantom Flea."</p>

<p>He might be angry at being recalled, and possibly
carry me off, soul and all. I turned and tossed about
restlessly in my bed, and kicked the bed-clothes on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the floor. The cold grey dawn broke in at my window.
I thought I would get up, so, giving one desperate spring,
I found myself upon my feet. My tongue was parched,
and a cold sweat matted my hair. I felt a prodigious
thirst, and emptied a whole water-bottle; then I proceeded
to dress, but I soon found that to shave was an
utter impossibility. My hand shook as with the palsy,
so I abandoned the attempt. Unshaven, unkempt, and
negligently dressed, with haggard look and listless
steps, I sauntered about the lonely corridors of the
mansion like a restless spirit, until I heard the footsteps
of Mrs. Wharton about the house. I started at the
slightest noise. I was soon accosted by that worthy,
who, of course, wanted to know how I had slept.</p>

<p>"I passed an indifferent night," I replied. "I
foolishly took some opium to make me sleep, and
it has given me the headache. By the by,"&mdash;I said,
to change the conversation, so as to avoid being questioned,
for I saw the old lady was scanning my countenance&mdash;"by
the by, where did you say the Baron was
staying? If not too far off, I should like to call
upon him; a walk might do me good."</p>

<p>"About five miles off, sir, in the next village, at
the sign of 'The Swan,'" said the housekeeper; "as
straight as ever you can go, sir, you can't miss it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor, gentleman," I heard the housekeeper
mutter to herself, as I started off, "I knew he would
suffer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>I set off at a brisk pace; the sun had just risen,
a silver mist was rising, and a gentle breeze somewhat
alleviated the fever of my burning brow, but my legs
felt weak. I tottered on for half-a-mile further; here
I found a mile-stone and sat down to rest upon it.
My reflections were gloomy. My recollections of the
previous night were painfully vivid. My dream, my
vision, my spiritual visitation, or whatever you like
to call it, did not vanish upon waking, like an ordinary
dream, but remained deeply rooted in my brain with
fearful accuracy of detail. I recollected word for
word all the monster had uttered; recalled his tone
of voice, his remarkable shape&mdash;that curious and
hideous blending of the characteristics of the flea
with the human form, the revolting, fiendish ugliness of
the <i>tout ensemble</i>, but above all, of that basilisk eye.
My blood ran cold as I thought of it.</p>

<p>"Have I then lived to hold converse with a being
of the lower world?" I muttered, to myself. "Am I
awake, or is this but a continuation of the dream?"
I gave my arm a pinch, a hard twisted pinch, with all
my might and main, to ascertain if I were sleeping or
waking, but the scene before me remained the same,
and my recollections of the past night were as vivid as
ever. I took off my hat to wipe my brow and let the
cool breeze play with my locks and about my heated
temples. I gazed at the smiling scene around me.
What a contrast to the hell I bore within.</p>

<p>"O glorious orb!" I ejaculated, "author and vivifier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of all nature, through every grade of creation, illumine
the haunted chambers of my dark soul with thy golden
beams; bring balm to my jaded spirit and renew the
bright hope of my earlier years. Give me strength to
bear my tottering limbs to the end of my pilgrimage;
or, if that be not granted me, take all there is left&mdash;take
my life, great orb of day! Type of my own once
aspiring youth, quicken my flagging energies and breathe
into me new life, new hope, new strength."</p>

<p>Whilst thus apostrophising the rising sun, I experienced
something like the fire of my boyish days
returning to my frame. I actually felt an appetite. I
rose from my seat considerably refreshed, and continued
my journey. I walked on with buoyant step; I had all
but forgotten the adventure of the past night. If it rose
up before me again at intervals, I speedily chased it
from my mind.</p>

<p>At length I espied the village in the distance.
Another half-mile led me up to the door of "The
Swan Inn." It was then about seven o'clock. A raw
country youth, evidently the boots, was beating a mat
outside the door.</p>

<p>"Is the Baron within?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wal, he b'ain't up yet, zur," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," I said, "I will wait, and as soon
as he is up tell him a gentleman is waiting to see him."</p>

<p>"Very well, zur."</p>

<p>"Would you like to wait here in the parlour, sir?"
said the buxom landlady, who had overheard our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dialogue. "The Baron can't be long; he is generally
up by this time, or if you will follow me, sir, I will
knock at his door, and you can wait in his sitting-room
till he comes out."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said, as I followed the landlady upstairs,
and was led into the sitting-room. The landlady
knocked at the Baron's door. No answer.</p>

<p>"Don't awake him, pray," said I, "if he's asleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, but the Baron told me to call him early, sir."</p>

<p>She knocked again. Again no answer. The landlady
paused a few moments to listen if he was getting up,
then tapped again louder, louder still, but all was silent.
The hostess ventured to open the door ajar. The
Baron was in bed. She entered the room. A pause, a
slight scream, and the landlady came running out to me,
pale and terrified.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she said, in a faint voice, "the Baron&mdash;the
Baron&mdash;is&mdash;<i>dead</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i>Dead!</i>" I exclaimed. "When? how?"</p>

<p>"It is true, sir. Come and see."</p>

<p>I entered the Baron's chamber. There he lay, sure
enough, to all appearance dead. I touched him; he
was as cold as ice. I was much struck with the singular
resemblance of the defunct Baron before me to the
portrait of Baron Ralph that hung over the mantelpiece
in my chamber. It is true that the Baron before
me was a younger man, that he wore a shaven face
instead of a moustache and peaked beard, that the livid
colour of the corpse was unlike the florid complexion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Baron Ralph; but the features were exact, the shape
of the head, the colour of the hair and the way it grew;
the same tufted red eyebrows, the right one considerably
higher than the left; the same bent flat nose and tightly
compressed lips, with cruel lines at the corners; the chin,
the jaw, the deep line between the brows, in fact, the
whole man seemed the exact counterpart of the old Baron.</p>

<p>A horrible recollection passed through my mind. I
remembered having seen the criminal before alluded to
after his execution. What a startling likeness between
the features of the executed criminal and those of the
Baron's corpse before me. I shuddered. A portion of
the phantom's conversation on the preceding night
occurred to me suddenly. What if&mdash;could it be that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I called the landlady. The whole inn was in a state
of confusion. The news of the Baron's death had
circulated through the whole village by this time.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "the Baron may not be quite
dead, he may be in a trance, he may be&mdash;&mdash; At any
rate, don't you think it would be best to send for the
doctor, to hear his opinion?"</p>

<p>The doctor was accordingly sent for, and arriving
shortly, was at once shown into the Baron's room. The
landlady and a great part of the household followed.</p>

<p>"Why, of course he's dead," replied the leech,
brusquely, in answer to their eager questions. "Can't
you see that?"</p>

<p>"If, nevertheless," said I, timidly, "you would not
mind opening a vein&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll open a vein, if you like," he answered, bluntly;
"but, I tell you, the man's dead!"</p>

<p>Then, taking out his lancet, he opened a vein in the
right arm.</p>

<p>"You see now, I hope," said the leech, "that it is
utterly useless; there is not a drop of blood."</p>

<p>"Then," said the landlady, "the Baron really <i>is</i>&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead! <i>Dead as mutton</i>," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>At this juncture the face of the corpse grew
violently convulsed, his eyes rolled, the colour returned
suddenly to his cheeks, and leaping from the bed with
terrific energy, he seized the bolster, with which he
belaboured the terrified inmates of "The Swan" right
and left, knocking over the little doctor, and sending
me into the landlady's lap, and the "boots" flying out
of the room with a yell of terror, besides upsetting every
utensil of crockery that stood in the way.</p>

<p>"Dead, am I!" roared the Baron, "dead, eh!
Where's that scurvy apothecary&mdash;that spreader of
plaisters, that pill-maker, that cow-bleeder&mdash;that dared
to open one of <i>my</i> veins?"</p>

<p>The little doctor had crept under the bed.</p>

<p>"And you, sir," cried he, turning upon me, "for
advising him to try his filthy experiments upon me," and
swinging round his bolster, sent me tottering against
the wall.</p>

<p>"Dead as <i>mutton</i>, eh! By the blood of my ancestors,
I never had such foul language used to me before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
What! compare the aristocratic flesh of one descended
from such a line of ancestors as mine to mutton!
Ugh! <i>Mutton</i>, quotha? I'll mutton <i>you</i>," cried the
Baron, aiming a blow at the little doctor's head, which
he caught peeping from beneath the bed.</p>

<p>The doctor ducked in his head, and attempted a
clandestine escape on his hands and knees by the door,
but was immediately pulled back by the coat-tails by
the Baron.</p>

<p>"Not so easily, young vein-opener, do you escape
the clutches of the Baron. Bind up my wound, Sir
Shaveling, and think yourself lucky that I spare your
paltry life for the vile trick which you, in your blind
ignorance of this phenomenon of my aristocratic constitution,
dared to practise upon me. Keep that instrument
for the bleeding of cows and horses. That's
more in your line than the flesh of great nobles like
me."</p>

<p>The Baron's wound was bleeding profusely. The
floor was covered with pools of blood. The landlady
had fallen into hysterics, and had to be carried out of
the room. The leech stammered out a sort of apology
and set meekly about his task of binding up the Baron's
wound.</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared the Baron, "and no more
prattle."</p>

<p>The arm being at length bound up, the doctor took
his departure without further severity on the part of the
Baron, who had now cooled down considerably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether it was the loss of blood, or what, a marked
change had taken place in the Baron's demeanour. He
apologised amply to me for the effects of hereditary
temper of which he was the victim, and invited me to
breakfast. The breakfast was brought up by the landlord
himself, as everyone else refused to enter the
Baron's apartments, saying that the Baron must be the
devil himself, and no one else.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said the Baron, addressing the landlord,
"that I frightened your good lady dreadfully this
morning, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, my lord," said the host, "she did take on
about it a little, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sincerely sorry for my rudeness," apologised
the Baron, "but my infirmity is ungovernable. It is a
disease I inherit from my ancestors; I am given every
now and then to some uncontrollable burst of passion
when my nerves are a little out of order, which is
generally the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my lord," said the good-hearted landlord,
with some compassion in his face, "but your lordship's
sudden coming to life again after the doctor had pronounced
you dead, that was what staggered us all downstairs."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the Baron. "Yes; well, I
dare say it did appear rather startling, but it is nothing
to those who know me. The fact is, I am subject to a
peculiar sort of trance, much resembling death; that
also I inherit from my ancestors."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my lord, it's strange. I hope it's nothing
dangerous. At any rate, I am glad to see your lordship
looking so well again," said the host.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, my good host," replied the
Baron.</p>

<p>"It would have been an ugly thing, you know, my
lord, for your lordship to have died suddenly in my inn.
It would have looked like foul play," said the landlord.</p>

<p>"True, true, my good host; I understand," replied
his lordship. "I trust you'll convey my best apologies
to your good lady for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I trust your lordship won't mention it," said
the landlord; "and if there is anything else your lordship
may require&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you," said the Baron; and the
landlord left the room.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the change in the Baron's manner.
Perhaps, after all, he might not be so bad as he
appeared. His infirmity of temper was certainly against
him. His personal appearance no less so. Nevertheless,
in his better moments he appeared to possess
the manners of a gentleman. I began to fancy that the
experiences of the past night might, after all, have been
a dream, until I caught sight again of the enormous
flea-bites on my hands, which still smarted.</p>

<p>The Baron's manner to me during breakfast was
most affable. After breakfast we left the inn together
and strolled leisurely towards the Hall. On the way
the Baron made me acquainted with the particulars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his case, and I promised to do the best I could to serve
him. Nevertheless, I saw at once that the Baron was
most decidedly in the wrong. I told him it was likely to
go hard with him; in fact, I said I did not see how he
could well get off.</p>

<p>The Baron frowned, and we walked on in silence
towards the Hall. That very day the case was tried at
the assizes, and in spite of all my efforts, the Baron lost.
I will not weary you with the details of the case.
Suffice it that there was oppression and injustice on the
part of the Baron which could not be excused, resulting
from a morbid belief in his own importance.</p>

<p>After the court broke up the Baron led me in silence
to the Hall and beckoned me to his room, the walls of
which were covered over with every sort of weapon of
defence under the sun. There were pistols, daggers,
blunderbusses, rapiers, broadswords, cutlasses, Malay
creases, poisoned spear heads, a two-handed sword,
probably belonging to his ancestor of cruel memory,
and an iron bar to which were attached a chain and ball
of spikes.</p>

<p>On entering the room he slammed the door, and
turning suddenly upon me, he hissed out, "Paltry
pettifogger, this is the second time that through your
d&mdash;&mdash;d bungling I have been brought to disgrace. Not
content with hanging me once, you have played me foul
a second time. But think not to escape me now," and
he cleared the room with one terrific stride. (Now
almost for the first time I noticed the enormous length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Baron's legs.) "Choose your weapons," he
cried, "and thank your stars that I don't fell you on the
spot as I would an ox."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;I don't see how you have a right to&mdash;to&mdash;I
did all in my power to&mdash;&mdash;" stammered I. "I
don't think you ought to be offended. Reflect, my
dear Baron," I said. "I am sure, in your better mood,
you will see the matter in another light."</p>

<p>"No more prating, but choose your weapon,"
screamed the Baron.</p>

<p>"Really, Baron," I said, "this conduct of yours is
contrary to all the generally received etiquette in
duelling. There are no seconds present, nothing
regular. I accept your challenge, if you really cannot
be brought to reason, but if I die, it must be like a
gentleman, in a regular duel, with all the usual ceremony."</p>

<p>"Driveller! dost prate to me of ceremony? But
have it your own way," said the Baron. "You do not
escape me this time."</p>

<p>"I will write to a friend of mine from town," I said.
"Meanwhile, I have the pleasure of wishing your lordship
a remarkably good morning."</p>

<p>I opened the door and made for the staircase,
but, with two immense strides, the Baron was at my
heels.</p>

<p>"Take that, Sir Bungler," cried he, and lifting one
of his enormous legs, lunged forth a kick upon that
part of my person anatomically known as the <i>Glut&aelig;us
Major</i>, which sent me flying from the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stairs to the bottom, at the imminent risk of breaking
my neck; but, as good luck would have it, I landed
safely on my feet. Nevertheless the insult stung me
to the quick.</p>

<p>I turned round indignantly, yet striving to master
my passion, in order to preserve my dignity, and said,
"Baron, you are no gentleman."</p>

<p>With the yell of a wounded tiger, the Baron vaulted
with one bound from the top of the staircase to the
bottom, just as my hand was on the door. I opened it
and slammed it again in his face, and walked briskly
in the direction of the village. I heard the door open
behind me and the Baron's fearful footsteps after me.</p>

<p>I do not know what would have become of me, if
just at that moment an over-driven bull had not come
to my rescue and stood between me and the Baron.
Seeing a man striding towards him furiously, he imagined
the attack was meant for himself, and accordingly
stood on the defensive. The Baron tried to pass,
but the bull lowered his horns, and looked menacing,
so he wisely retreated to his Hall.</p>

<p>Arrived at "The Swan," I demanded pen, ink, and
paper, and wrote to my friend in town to come to me
for the purpose of performing the office of second,
after which I endeavoured to kill time in this lonely
village till dinner. Feeling hungry, I made a sumptuous
repast and turned into bed with feelings full of
revenge towards the Baron.</p>

<p>"No more Phantom Fleas to-night," I said to myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
as I tucked myself up in my comfortable little bed at
"The Swan," and soon fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>And now, said the lawyer, when he had got thus
far in his narrative, I must root up an old and very
painful subject that occurred in my early life, and which
I would fain have allowed to rest for ever.</p>

<p>In my earlier days, when as yet I had no fixed
profession, during my travels in Italy, I became
enamoured of a beautiful Italian girl. Poor Mariangela!
how she loved me! That girl possessed the soul of an
angel. I see her before me now, with her sweet,
dreamy, saintlike eyes, and her quiet graceful step. We
were never married, for I was not in a position then to
support a wife. She vowed that she would never love
anyone else but me. We parted, and&mdash;and&mdash;she died;
died through love of me.</p>

<p>(Here the lawyer became visibly affected and hastily
brushed away a tear-drop with his hand. Mastering
himself at length, he resumed.)</p>

<p>On her death-bed she sent for me. I arrived
just in time to catch her parting breath. When I
stooped down to kiss her she hung a small relic of
some saint that had been blessed by the Pope,
suspended with a piece of ribbon, round my neck, and
begged me to wear it for her sake, and said that it
would preserve me from all harm. Poor girl! she died
in my arms; I followed her to the grave and was for a
long time inconsolable.</p>

<p>But time, that changes everything, changed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
A tender recollection of her past love only remained;
the wild tumultuous passion I had felt for her while
living, and the overwhelming grief I experienced at her
death, had subsided. For two years I wore the relic
she gave me round my neck. Not because I believed
in its virtue, not being a Roman Catholic myself, but
for her sake alone&mdash;in remembrance of <i>her</i>. Afterwards,
however, I wore it less often, and at length
discontinued wearing it altogether. I kept it still at the
bottom of my trunk, between the leaves of a book.</p>

<p>This trunk I left in town when I went down to the
Baron's. The key, I must tell you, I had lost a day or
two before. I was just thinking of sending for the
locksmith when I received the Baron's letter to come
down to his place for a day or two. I left town
hurriedly and the box behind me, locked&mdash;the key lost.</p>

<p>Ever since poor Mariangela's death, even long
after I had ceased to think of her regularly, I have
remarked that in those periods of my life when I was
in any difficulty her spirit used to appear to me in a
dream and counsel me, and being guided by her
counsel, I found my way invariably out of my dilemma.
When weighed down by any great grief she was sure to
appear and console me.</p>

<p>That night when I turned into my snug little bed
at "The Swan," no one was further from my thoughts
than that poor Italian girl who loved me so well. My
thoughts were far too full of ill-feeling towards the
Baron and the preparations for the coming duel to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
room for anything else. Nevertheless, I had a most
remarkable dream towards morning. I thought
Mariangela came towards me as I lay in bed, and
reproached me for having left off wearing the charm
that she had hung round my neck.</p>

<p>"Your life is in danger," she said. "Good swordsman
and expert with the pistol as you are, you are no
match for the Baron with either, whose skill is from the
Evil One. Listen to me, and do not refuse my last
petition. Wear this round your neck, and it will protect
you from all harm."</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, she kissed me on the brow and
vanished. I awoke, and would you believe it, gentlemen,
I found suspended round my neck that identical
relic that I left at the bottom of my trunk in town, the
key of which was lost. Well, I could no longer doubt
this being a spiritual visitation, so I left the relic there
suspended.</p>

<p>In the course of the day my friend arrived. The
usual ceremonies were gone through, and the meeting
was to be at sundown, in a wood belonging to the
Baron's estate. A surgeon was also provided to bind
up the wounds of the one who should fall, should they
not be mortal. As I was asked my choice of weapon,
I chose the rapier, having at that time no inconsiderable
skill in the use of it.</p>

<p>The hour arrived, and we met on the spot. The
Baron, at the sight of me, was unable to restrain his
rage, and it was with difficulty that he was prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from breaking through every rule of etiquette appertaining
to the duello. Without waiting for the
customary salute beforehand, he rushed at me sword in
hand at the first sight of me like a savage. The seconds
interfered, and something like order was restored.</p>

<p>We advanced, retired, clashed swords, lunged,
parried. "<i>Tierce</i>, <i>quarte</i>, <i>quinte</i>, <i>flanconade</i>, single
attack, double attack, lunge."</p>

<p>The Baron lunged furiously, I parried, and the
Baron was disarmed. Without waiting for my permission
to pick up his sword, he, disregarding all
etiquette, made a sudden grab at it, and flew at me
again in fury. The Baron's fencing was very wild. He
made three or four successive desperate lunges at me,
but was foiled every time. He grew more and more
furious; he had never been accustomed to be thus
thwarted.</p>

<p>I felt my hand grow lame, however. It was like
fencing with Mephistopheles. To tire him out was
impossible. His long wind was his <i>forte</i>. I could
only try to match the Baron's fury by the most guarded
coolness and self-possession. For some time past I
had done nothing but parry, waiting calmly for an
opportunity. At length an opening presented itself. I
lunged, and the Baron fell, pierced right through the
heart, at the foot of one of his own stately oaks. He
rolled up his eyes, and after death still retained the
same expression of ferocity that he wore when living.</p>

<p>Thus died the last Baron &mdash;&mdash;. With his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the line became extinct, and the property fell into other
hands. Duelling even in those days was fast falling
into disuse, and I had to fly the country. I travelled
for many years, and at length returned home, but never
from the day of the duel up to the present time have I
once neglected to wear the pious relic of that poor
Italian girl round my neck.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bursts of applause followed the lawyer's recital.
Mr. Blackdeed said it ought to be dramatised; that
it would "create a sensation," and "bring down the
house." The doctor shook his head gravely. The
chairman, in a short speech, proposed the health of the
narrator, and expressed a hope that he might be free
from all such clients for the future.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers!" cried Captain Toughyarn,
"if that yarn won't do for the marines. Odds, blood
and thunder, if I thought anyone but a tar could have
spun such a yarn as that. I tell you what it is, Hardcase,
you've mistaken your calling. You were meant
for the sea."</p>

<p>"I hope, Captain Toughyarn," said the lawyer,
"you don't doubt the veracity of my statement."</p>

<p>"Not I," answered the captain, but with a most
provoking look of scepticism, which belied his words.</p>

<p>"I do believe the captain's a sceptic," said the
chairman. "Take care, captain, the rules of this club
are severe. If any member or guest presumes to doubt
the statement of any other member of the club, given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out by the said member as a fact, he shall incur the
penalty of being forced to drink a cup of cold water on
his bended knees, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" groaned the captain, before the chairman
had finished his sentence. "Well, chairman," he said,
humbly awed at the severity of the sentence, "I don't
mean to say that I'll give a 'lee lurch,' and throw Mr.
Hardcase's cargo overboard altogether; but the fact is
I have been on shore so long, that I have got quite
out of the way of shipping those sorts of goods into my
hold, and it rather sticks in my tramway, but I have no
doubt that another glass of grog will send it clean down,
and that I shall find storage-room in my hull for that
and as much more cargo as any of our messmates
choose to ship this evening."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear," cried the guests, passing the bowl
towards the captain, who, after having filled up his glass
and drained it, declared himself ready to set sail.</p>

<p>"Another bowl, landlord!" shouted the chairman;
"and whilst you are about it, you might bring up another
log as well. See how the cold makes the fire burn."
Then, turning to his guest, Mr. Vandyke McGuilp,
he observed, "It is lucky you arrived in time to-night
for our great meeting. You have now heard a specimen
of these stories, the fame of which has reached Rome."</p>

<p>At this moment the host returned with a fresh
bowl of punch, which was received with a murmur of
approbation. The landlord then stirred up the fire,
and put on a fresh log. It was getting late, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was nothing for the members of the "Wonder Club"
on such an occasion as this.</p>

<p>"It's freezing hard to-night, sir," said the landlord
to the chairman.</p>

<p>"Is it, mine host?" said Mr. Oldstone, rendered
still more good humoured under the influence of the
punch. "Then fill up a bumper and drink to the
health of our club, after which you may sit down here
and listen to the next story, if you can prevent falling
asleep. Our first story you have missed. Oh, I can
assure you it would have given you the horrors to have
listened to it."</p>

<p>Here our worthy host filled up a glass, and, nodding
his head, drank to the long life of all the members and
guests, and hoped that the club might have as many
more anniversaries as there were hairs in the heads of
all the members put together.</p>

<p>This sentiment was received with applause, and the
health of the landlord was drunk with three times three.
He replied to it in a short, bluff, and unembarrassed
speech, amid cheers; and rattling of glasses. Then
modestly taking a seat at some little distance from the
table, filled his pipe, lighted it, and put himself into a
listening attitude.</p>

<p>"It is your turn now, doctor," said the chairman.
"We're all waiting, and, mind, we all expect a good
one. On this evening, gentlemen, each one must strive
to outdo his neighbour."</p>

<p>"I cannot promise that I will outdo Mr. Hardcase's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
narrative," said the doctor, modestly, "but I will do my
best to add to the entertainment of the company in my
humble way."</p>

<p>"Bravo, doctor!" cried several voices at once.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone thumped the table and called out,
"Silence, gentlemen; Dr. Bleedem will favour us with
a story."</p>

<p>Silence immediately ensued, and the doctor began.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>The Spirit Lovers.&mdash;The Doctor's Story.</h3>

<p>I am about to relate, gentlemen, a curious incident
in my medical experience, many years ago.</p>

<p>When I was yet a young practitioner I had already
a numerous circle of patients, out of which it will be
only necessary for me to bring two cases before you this
evening. The first was that of a young man of about
four-and-twenty, whom I shall call Charles. He was of
good family, and his parents were moderately well off.
I was called to his bedside, the former doctor having
been dismissed. I had had some conversation with
the parents of the young man before I was ushered
into his presence. They informed me that my predecessor
had pronounced his disease "a rapid decline"
and as incurable. But the case had other peculiarities
which puzzled him. The brain, he said, was much
affected.</p>

<p>The patient ate little, unlike other consumptive
subjects, whose appetites are usually enormous. He
slept much, and talked much in his sleep, but in his
waking moments he was irritable and restless, and preferred
being left alone all day. He could not even bear
the sight of his own parents in his room. He had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
regular hours of sleep, and always seemed to look
forward to his hours of rest, especially to his nightly
hours.</p>

<p>I questioned the parents as to how long he had
been in this state. They told me more than a year.
I inquired if any member of their family had ever
died of consumption. They replied that not one,
either on the father's side or the mother's, bore the
slightest trace of that malady, and that for many
generations back the members of both families had
lived to a good old age. Neither of the parents could
give the slightest account of how the disease originated.</p>

<p>Their son had been sent to the university two or
three years before, where he had studied hard, but without
having made up his mind to follow any particular
profession. They suggested that possibly over-study had
sewn the seeds of the disease. He was not, as they
assured me, given to dissipation.</p>

<p>Having ascertained these particulars, I expressed a
desire to see the patient, and was shewn into the sick-room.
The parents told me to prepare for a cool
reception, as their son was not over partial to visitors,
and especially doctors. They then retired, leaving me
alone with the patient, as I had previously requested
them; for it has always been my policy to work myself
as much as possible into the confidence of my patients,
in order to obtain more minute particulars of their case
which otherwise they might be reserved upon. For this
a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> is absolutely necessary, as there are patients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
who are reserved even in the presence of their nearest
relatives and friends.</p>

<p>The young man, as I entered, was seated in bed,
propped up by cushions. He was in a thoughtful
attitude, and for some moments seemed unconscious of
my presence. At length, hearing my footsteps, he
started, glared wildly at me, and turned his face to
the wall.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, soothingly, "don't be frightened;
I am only the new doctor. I have come to see if I
can't make something out of your case. Come, turn
round. I daresay we shall be better friends before long.
What is this?" I asked, as I laid my hand upon a
volume hidden under the clothes, and examined it.
"Ah, Shakespeare!"</p>

<p>"Don't touch it," cried the young man, starting up
with sudden energy. "I never allow my Shakespeare
to be polluted by strange hands."</p>

<p>I was rather startled at this sudden burst of irritability
from my new patient, especially in the exhausted
state in which I found him, and not a little amused at
the oddity of his caprice.</p>

<p>"You are a great admirer of Shakespeare?" I
observed, after a pause.</p>

<p>He did not deign a reply, but fell back languidly on
his cushions and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"A great poet," I continued. "What insight into
character! What knowledge of mankind! What a
versatile genius! With what truth and exquisite feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he portrays both the king and the peasant, the courtier
and the jester! How truly he seizes the leading
characteristics of the Jew and the Christian in his
'Merchant of Venice,' to say nothing of his sublime
imagination in the 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' and in
'The Tempest'; the exquisite humours, too, of his
'Merry Wives of Windsor,' and then there is his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this juncture my patient opened his eyes, and
gave me a look that seemed to say, "Have you done
yet?" and, after a pause, said aloud, "I thought you
were the doctor."</p>

<p>"Ah! truly," said I, blushing slightly; "I am
afraid, I weary you. Pardon me if my enthusiasm
for your great poet has carried me away from my
professional duties. But, to business. How do you
feel at present?"</p>

<p>He eyed me with a peculiar expression, and said,
"Do you really want to know?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I do; haven't I come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have heard that I have been given over as
incurable. The last doctor was an older man than
you. What do you hope to effect?"</p>

<p>"To effect a cure; <i>I</i> do not give you up. I do <i>not</i>
think your disease is consumption. I hope in time
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?" he asked, nervously.</p>

<p>"Well, to be able to serve you."</p>

<p>"No," he cried, "not to <i>serve</i> me, but to <i>cure</i> me."</p>

<p>"In curing you, shall I not serve you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I do not want to be cured. Leave me to
die, if you want to serve me."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear young man," I cried, "don't talk like
that. Your malady is not of the sort that you need fear
death so soon."</p>

<p>"Fear death!" he exclaimed. "On the contrary, I
seek death. I desire to die."</p>

<p>"What! you desire to die? A young man like you,
in the pride of your youth, with the whole world before
you. What can make you so tired of your life?"</p>

<p>"Because my life's a burden to me."</p>

<p>"Poor young man," I said, "can you have suffered
so much! Ah," I muttered, half to myself, "youth has
its sufferings as well as age."</p>

<p>I was young myself then, and I had suffered. I felt
the deepest sympathy for my patient.</p>

<p>"If," I resumed, "in curing you I could make life
cease to be a burden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would not accept the offer," he replied. "What
should I gain by it? The grosser material part of my
nature would be rendered more gross, more material;
capable only of those delights that the grossest minds
revel in, to the utter exclusion of those sublime visions
and inspirations which visit the soul when least clogged
with matter. It would be to exchange a paradise for a
pandemonium; high, exalted thoughts and feelings for
low and grovelling ones. No," he said; "he who,
like me, has tasted both lives will hardly throw away
the higher for the lower."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>I was puzzled by this last speech of his. Was the
brain really affected? Had I to do with a case of
insanity? I studied his physiognomy for some time in
silence. He would have been called decidedly handsome;
and yet that is not the word. I should rather
say beautiful, but the complexion was pallid and the
face dreadfully emaciated. The forehead was ample,
but half-eclipsed by a mass of rich, chestnut hair that
hung over his head in disordered waves. The nose
was Grecian; the mouth and chin classic; the eyes
were large, dark, and lustrous, with an expression most
unusual and indescribable.</p>

<p>If I may use the expression, he seemed to look
through you and beyond you into space. The expression
was quite unlike the vacant stare of the maniac, for
the look abounded with superior intelligence, but yet it
was not that sort of intelligence which men get by
mixing in the world. His look had something <i>unearthly</i>
in it&mdash;something of another world. I could not
altogether bring myself to believe that he was mad. He
would certainly have been called so by the world at
large, which calls everything madness that does not come
within its own narrow circle. His madness was that his
faculties were too acute, his nervous system too sensitive.
When he looked at me he seemed to read my
inmost thoughts and answer them all with his eyes
before I had time to open my mouth to give utterance
to them.</p>

<p>I tried to reason with him, tried to show him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
very good health was compatible with the most exalted
thoughts, etc. But he always had an answer ready, and
that, too, before the words were half out of my mouth.
He was a perfect study, and I took immense interest in
him. He, in turn, grew more docile and confiding, and
after some five or six visits we were the best of friends.</p>

<p>I have said that he slept much and was given much
to talking in his sleep. It was on my third visit that I
had some experience of this. We were in the midst of
an animated discussion, when he suddenly went off
into a most profound slumber; more suddenly than I
had ever before known anyone to fall asleep, and
so resembling death that for some time I thought
him dead. At length his lips began to move, and
for more than an hour he kept up a conversation
with someone in his dream, part of which conversation
I committed to paper.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "this is the spot appointed,
and no one near. This is the trysting tree, yonder the
blue mountains, here the rocks. It is past the hour.
Oh, where is she? Will she not come? Must I return
to that darkness mortals call life without seeing her,
without hearing one word? Oh, Edith! shake off
these bonds of flesh but for one hour, if, indeed, you
also have a life of clay like me, and are not all spirit.
Can you not spare me <i>one</i> hour? Ah! footsteps! A
bush crackles. Edith, Edith! how glad I am you have
come at last. I was afraid you had been prevented.
Why are you so late? What do I see&mdash;tears? Tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
what has happened. Does your father know of our
meetings? But how should he? Are we not in the
spirit? Come, tell me all."</p>

<p>Here a pause ensued, as if the lady he was addressing
was speaking, during which time the expression of
his face changed several times; first from one of
deep tenderness, next, to that of profound melancholy.
He sighed, then again a bright smile illumined his
countenance. Occasionally a slight frown would cloud
his brow for an instant, and his countenance bore a
look of determination. At length he spoke again in
earnest tones.</p>

<p>"Come what may, I will never leave you. Have
I not sworn? Are you not mine to all eternity? We
may never meet in the flesh; but what of that. Are
we not happier thus? Unshackled from that fearful
darkness that wars against our spirits? Oh, that we
may ever live thus! Would that we could become all
spirit."</p>

<p>Another pause ensued, and after some minutes he
resumed.</p>

<p>"And how can your father's paltry caprices affect
us&mdash;whilst we are in the spirit, how can the weapons of
the flesh attack us?"</p>

<p>A pause, and then he said, "True, as you say, we
are not always in the spirit, and then of course we must
be subject to&mdash;&mdash; But what is it you fear, Edith?"</p>

<p>Again a pause.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he began again, "that that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
very thought that has been passing through my mind
for some time past. Oh, horrible! If one of us
or both should get entirely cured, so that the doors
of the flesh should close upon us for ever, our spiritual
life desert us, without even the prospect of meeting in
the flesh!" Here he groaned deeply. "How long
will this last, this dream of bliss? It began but a year
ago. If we could only escape altogether from our
earthly bodies! but I feel that is impossible as yet;
while I speak I feel attracted again towards clay. I am
unable to resist; I feel myself torn away. I am going&mdash;going.
Farewell, Edith."</p>

<p>The next moment he awoke. I folded up the
paper on which I had been writing and placed it in my
pocket; then turned to my patient. I have not given
here one half of the conversation, I was unable to
follow him with my pen the greater part of the time, for
at times he would speak very rapidly, at other times
sink his voice so low that I could not catch all he
uttered.</p>

<p>"I am here again, then," he muttered to himself,
with a groan. "When will this end?"</p>

<p>"You have had pleasant dreams, I hope," said I
with a smile.</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously, and said, "You
have heard me? Then you know all!"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, all about that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing," I replied. "It is true you talked
in your sleep; you have been dreaming."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Call it a dream, if you like," he said. "I exist
but in such dreams, and my waking life is to me but a
nightmare."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" I said. "You must not take
such a morbid view of things. Your brain at present
is in a state of fever. We cannot expect always to be
well. I'll give you a composing draught, and in time I
hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Throw physic to the dogs," he replied, quoting
from his favourite author. "Canst thou not minister to
a mind diseased?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "I might manage to do that as
well, if you will bide by my instructions."</p>

<p>"Look here, doctor," he said, at length, "I shall
be very happy to see you whenever you come, to talk
with you as a friend, as long as I remain upon earth,
but I refuse point blank to take any of your medicine,
so I don't deceive you."</p>

<p>I tried to expostulate; but how can one reason
with a man who wants to die, and try to persuade him
to take physic, itself nauseous, but to bring him back
to the life which he despises? My task was a difficult
one, but I bethought me of a plan. I pretended to
humour him, and took my leave, saying I would call
again shortly.</p>

<p>On leaving the sick-room I entered the parlour,
where the parents of the invalid awaited me, to hear
my opinion of the case. I told them that the patient's
nerves were in a most sensitive state; I had heard him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
talk much in his sleep; that the brain wanted repose.
I told them that he had refused to take any of my
medicine because he was tired of his life and did not
wish to prolong it.</p>

<p>I then wrote out a prescription, which I told them
to get made up at the chemist's. It was a composing
draught which I desired them to administer in
a tumbler of water, likewise pouring in some sweet
syrup to hide the nauseous taste. Whenever he complained
of thirst this medicine was to be given him.
In this manner he would be forced to take my
medicines, and might recover in spite of himself.</p>

<p>Before leaving the house I inquired of Charles'
mother if she were aware of any love affair of her son's
that might have sown the first seeds of this illness.
She replied in the negative, but that she was aware that
he often mentioned a lady's name in his sleep&mdash;the
name "Edith."</p>

<p>She assured me that there was not a single young
lady of her acquaintance who bore that name; that she
was at a loss to conceive how he could have made the
acquaintance of any lady for the last two years without
her knowing it, as he had led such a very retired life
since he had left the university. Truly, he might have
made her acquaintance whilst at Oxford, but, then,
he had never shown any symptoms of his present
malady for long after.</p>

<p>I left the house, giving them all the hope I could,
and promised to call again on the morrow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
morrow arrived, and I called again. My draught had
been administered, and I thought that my patient was
a degree less nervous. Whether it was my fancy or
what, I know not, but it seemed to me that the invalid
suspected I had been tampering with him. He said
nothing, but I thought I read it in his eyes.</p>

<p>"How did you sleep last night?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied; "but somehow I fancy that my
dreams last night were less vivid."</p>

<p>"Not a bad sign," I observed. "Dreaming is a bad
thing&mdash;sign of a disordered stomach."</p>

<p>"Some dreams&mdash;not all," he replied.</p>

<p>"No, not all; but those very vivid dreams that you
allude to all proceed from a bad digestion or over-heated
brain."</p>

<p>"Then, you set down all dreams to some physical
cause?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I; "though the character of the
dream will be shaped according to our waking thoughts."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he replied, "generally it is so. I
myself once used to have those sort of dreams. But
have you never met with a patient who lived two
separate existences, whose spirit during sleep wandered
into those realms allotted to it; returning upon waking
to the body, there to drag out a wretched existence in
the world, among the hum of men, and pass his melancholy
hours longing for the night, when his spirit would
be again set free from its prison, to wander unrestrained
through those realms of space untrodden by mortal foot?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never," I replied; "and if I were to meet with a
man who imagined he passed two different existences,
what proof have I that his dreams are nothing more
than imagination? What proof have I that he <i>really
does</i> live two separate lives?"</p>

<p>"Proof such as you would desire to have I admit is
difficult; but let us suppose a case. What would you
say if, in the course of a life-time's experience, you were
to find some few, very rare, cases of men as I describe,
who believe, as you would say, that their spirit during
sleep leaves the body and revels in a world of its own.
That you were to read of some few other cases of the
same sort that have occurred now and then at rare
intervals since the world began, and that the written
description of that abode unknown to mortal tread, were
to tally in every particular with the descriptions you
yourself received from some of your patients?"</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "I should say, either that my
patients had been reading these old legends until their
brains were turned, or that it was a malady, and, like all
other maladies, was manifested by certain special
symptoms. Hence the similarity of the descriptions."</p>

<p>"I knew that would be your reply," he observed.
"Doctor, doctor," he continued, shaking his head,
"you have a great deal to learn."</p>

<p>"Have you, then," I enquired, "ever met with a
man of that sort?"</p>

<p>"I know <i>one</i>. What should you say, doctor, if I
myself was one of those men?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"You! I should say that your imagination deluded
you, that your present ill state of health is sufficient to
account for any freak of the brain, however eccentric."</p>

<p>"Deluded mortal," he muttered. "Alas! by what
circuitous paths do men persistently seek for error,
when the high road of Truth lies ever before their
eyes."</p>

<p>We discoursed upon various other topics, and I
took my leave of Charles, leaving instructions with his
parents concerning the treatment of their son, as I
should not be able to call again for some days. I had
to attend a young lady in the country, the adopted
daughter of a very old friend of mine. I could not
refuse to go, so I started next day by the mail.</p>

<p>Charles' conversation had impressed me deeply, and
I meditated upon it as I sat perched up outside the
stage-coach. I was sorry to leave him, for I had
already felt quite an affection for him, independently of
the interest I took in his case.</p>

<p>And who was this young lady that I was called
upon to visit in such a hurry? I had never seen her,
but for the sake of my friend who had benefited me in
so many ways in the commencement of my career, I
could not do otherwise than leave town for a short
time.</p>

<p>I tried to picture to myself my new patient&mdash;some
bread-and-butter girl with the mumps, hysteria, whooping-cough,
or chicken-pox. The picture I mentally
drew of my lady patient was not sentimental; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the fact was, I was irritated at being obliged to
leave such an interesting case as that in which I was
engaged. During the course of my drive I entered
into conversation with the driver. I asked him if he
knew Squire L&mdash;&mdash;. He replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said I, pretending not to know the
squire over well, in order to draw him out, "the squire
has no family, I think?"</p>

<p>"None of his own, sir. He has one adopted
daughter, a foundling, found somewhere near Stratford-on-Avon.
The squire has adopted her ever since,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What age is the young lady?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, she must now be hard upon four-and-twenty,
though she did not look it last time I saw her."</p>

<p>"As old as that!" I exclaimed. "Then she will be
getting married soon, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not she, sir."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked. "Isn't she personally
attractive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe you, sir," said the coachman,
enthusiastically, and turning up his eyes. "There is
not a face in the whole place for miles round that can
hold a candle to her."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "The squire is rich, too, as
I hear, and I suppose she will be his heiress. What
is your reason for believing that she will not marry?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, she has such ill health; she never leaves
the house. Folks say as how she will never recover."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, and how long has she been thus?"</p>

<p>"About a year ago she was first seized; since then
I have not seen her. When I last saw her wasn't she a
beauty, neither!"</p>

<p>"I suppose this illness will have pulled her down a
little. By the by, what is the nature of her complaint?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hardly know, sir, and that's the truth, what
it is that do ail her. Some folks call it consumption,
others call it something else."</p>

<p>"Who is her medical attendant?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Doctor W&mdash;&mdash;, sir; lives down yonder."</p>

<p>"What does he say it is?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, sir, I don't think he knows more
about it than other folks. Them doctors, when they
once gets into a house, there's no getting them out
again; and as for the good they do, they dose you, they
bleed you&mdash;ay, bleed you in both senses of the word!
Ha! ha! You know what I mean, sir."</p>

<p>I was disgusted at the vulgar contempt of this
man for the noble profession of which I myself was a
member, and was determined not to laugh at his low
wit. I passed over his execrable joke with gravity, so
as not to appear to see it.</p>

<p>"If the doctor knows so little about it," I said, at
length, "what do the people say it is? What is the
popular opinion of the young lady's malady? What are
the symptoms?"</p>

<p>I saw by the coachman's countenance that he was
rather surprised at the interest I took in the health of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the young lady, and I fancy he suspected that I was a
doctor.</p>

<p>"Symptoms, sir!" he cried. "Oh, sir, very strange
ones, they say."</p>

<p>"How strange?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, there be a good many strange reports
about the squire's adopted daughter. I b'ain't a-goin' to
give credit to everything I hear, but folks <i>do</i> say&mdash;&mdash;"
here he lowered his voice almost to a whisper and
looked mysteriously, first over one shoulder, then over
the other.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "Folks say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, folks <i>do</i> say that the young lady, leastways,
the squire's adopted daughter, is&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;" (here
he put his finger to his lips and looked still more
mysterious).</p>

<p>"Well?" said I, impatiently.</p>

<p>"That the poor young lady is under some evil spell&mdash;that
she is <i>bewitched</i>."</p>

<p>"Dear me! you don't say so," I exclaimed, with
well-feigned astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied; "leastways, so folks say
about here."</p>

<p>"How very dreadful! Poor young lady! Perhaps
she is in love. Love is the only witchcraft that ever
came in the way of my experience," I remarked.</p>

<p>"And sure, sir, you're not far out there neither; for
if there's one thing more like witchcraft than another, it
is that same <i>love</i>. Lor', bless yer, sir, don't I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
when I was courtin' my Poll, how I'd stand under her
winder of a rainy night for hours, just to get a peep at
her shadow on the winder blind, and how I'd go for
days without my beer, till folks didn't know what to
make of me? Ah! but I got over it, though, in time.
I got cured, but" (here he gave me a knowing look)
"it wasn't by a <i>doctor</i>. No, sir, it wasn't by a <i>doctor</i>," he
said, with a contemptuous emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>"Now, who do you think it was by, sir, that I got
cured?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea," I replied, dryly,
disgusted at the man's manner.</p>

<p>"Why, the <i>Parson</i>! to be sure," he exclaimed.
"Ha, ha!" giving me a dig in the ribs with his undeveloped
thumb. "Yes, sir, the parson beat the
doctor out and out in that ere business. He, he!"</p>

<p>I dare say the joke was very witty, but I was in no
humour for laughing just then; yet, after all, he did not
know I was a doctor, so I condescended to give a grin,
a spasmodic grin like that a corpse may be supposed to
give when the risible muscles are set in motion by the
wires of a galvanic battery.</p>

<p>He then began to relate to me some of the many
superstitions afloat concerning the above-mentioned
lady, till I grew curious to make the acquaintance of
my new patient. In the middle of one of his long
stories, he pointed out to me the house of my friend
Squire L&mdash;&mdash;, so I descended and walked up the hill
leading to his house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived there, I rang, and was shown into the
parlour, and upon giving my name, was soon cordially
received by my old friend. We had not met for years.
He had much to tell me, and seemed very much
concerned about the health of his adopted daughter,
whom he loved as if she had been his own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>His wife soon entered, and having expressed much
pleasure at seeing me after so long, began giving me
the peculiar symptoms of the lady's case.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to make of her, my dear
doctor," she said; "for a whole year past she has not
been the same girl. She will not eat, nor see anyone;
seems quite estranged towards us, gets nervous and
irritable if anyone approaches her; sleeps much and
talks much during her sleep, and frequently imagines in
her dream that she is holding conversation with a young
man whom she addresses as Charles."</p>

<p>I started. The lady and her husband both noticed
my emotion, and inquired into its cause. I told them
that the case of their adopted daughter so nearly
resembled the case of a young man in London whom I
was still in the habit of attending, that the similarity of
the symptoms struck me with no little surprise.</p>

<p>"Indeed, doctor," said the lady. "Is it possible that
there can be two such extraordinary cases in the world?"</p>

<p>I mused a little, and then observed, "You do not
think, do you, that the first cause of this strange malady
was some little affair of the heart?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear no, doctor," she replied. "I am certain
of it. The girl has never had the opportunity of
forming the acquaintance of any young men. She has
never left this village in her life, though she has often
begged me to take her to London; but somehow I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! you say she has never been to London&mdash;not
even for a day?"</p>

<p>"Never," she replied.</p>

<p>I began musing to myself, when I was interrupted
from my train of thought by the voice of the patient
calling out, in agonising tones, "Charles! Charles!"</p>

<p>"Edith, my love! what <i>is</i> the matter?" cried Mrs.
L&mdash;&mdash;, rising and leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Edith!" I muttered to myself. "How strange!
What a strange link between the two cases." I did not
know what to make of it all. However, I kept the
particulars of Charles' case to myself for the present,
and determined to investigate the matter closely.</p>

<p>"Can I see the patient?" I asked of my old friend.</p>

<p>"Certainly; we will go together," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I should prefer a private interview
with her, if possible. Patients sometimes will not be
communicative to the doctor in presence of others,
even though they be their own relations. It is always
my plan to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, exactly, doctor," he replied; "but I am afraid
she will not give you a very warm reception."</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied, "as to that, I am accustomed to
the very worst of receptions from some of my patients."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>My friend led me to the chamber of the young
lady, whom I discovered in bed, propped up by cushions,
talking to Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"This is Dr. Bleedem, my love," said the squire.
"Now, don't be shy, but tell him all that you feel the
matter with you. I shall leave him alone with you.
Don't be nervous; he is a very old friend of mine."</p>

<p>Then, beckoning to his wife, he drew her away, and
left me alone with my patient.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me upon entering the
chamber was the remarkable likeness my new patient
bore to Charles. They might well have been brother
and sister, though the hair of Edith was dark and her
eyes a deep grey. The features were wonderfully alike,
and the eyes had that same strange unearthly expression
I have already described as belonging to Charles.
Contrary to my expectations, she received me most
civilly; very differently to the manner in which I was
treated by Charles on our first interview. I was at a
loss to account for this, as my friend had warned me
not to hope for a very warm reception.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor!" she exclaimed, "I am so glad you
have come. Your presence brings me relief. You are
the only person whose sight I have been able to tolerate
for this last year and more."</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck. What could she mean?
"Some caprice, I suppose. Perhaps my old friend has
been putting in a good word for me."</p>

<p>"No, doctor," she said, answering to my thoughts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a manner that perfectly amazed me; "no; it is not
as you think. The squire never told me until this
moment that you were an old friend of his. It is not
for that that I feel myself drawn towards you by some
almost unaccountable sympathy; but, to tell you the
truth, doctor, I have long felt the want of someone to
confide in, and you are just the one; you must forgive
my boldness, if it offends you, whom I should like to
make my father confessor."</p>

<p>I smiled at the innocent want of restraint with
which she uttered these words, and said I should be
most happy to fulfil the office.</p>

<p>"Should you, doctor?" she replied. "Well, I shall
be most unreserved towards you, and I hope you will
return the compliment, and tell me all it is in your
power to communicate."</p>

<p>I looked surprised, and asked, "Of what&mdash;of whom
would you hear?"</p>

<p>"Doctor," she said, fixing upon me those deep grey
orbs, with a glance that seemed to read my inmost soul,
"do not deceive me; you <i>know</i> that you have been
with <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Who can she mean?" I mentally asked. "Can
she mean Charles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered to my thought, "with <i>him</i>&mdash;with
<i>Charles</i>. Hide nothing from me, doctor. I see
you look surprised that I should know where you come
from; but my senses are too keen, too abnormally
acute, not to perceive that you carry about you <i>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
particles of his being</i> as unmistakably as if you had
been amongst roses or honeysuckles. Can I be
deceived when you come to me directly from the
chamber of the only man I ever loved in my life, with
the atoms of his nature clinging to you? Think you
that I know aught of your doings? That I have been
informed as to where <i>he</i> lives? I tell you, No; I know
nothing but what my senses tell me. I feel you have
been with him, and whatever you might tell me to
the contrary would not make me believe otherwise."</p>

<p>"Well," I said smiling, "I don't deny that I <i>have</i>
just come from a patient in London, whose name is
Charles; but London is large, and there are many
Charleses."</p>

<p>"I do not care <i>where</i> your patient is&mdash;whether at
London or the North Pole, I shall probably never come
across him; in fact, I don't see that it would aid matters
much if I were to. I have never seen him&mdash;that is to
say, with these eyes&mdash;and probably never may," she
said, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Do I understand you to say that you have never
seen this young man you talk about, and yet you take
so much interest in him?"</p>

<p>"Never with the eyes of the body," she replied.</p>

<p>"How, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With the eyes of the spirit."</p>

<p>"That is to say," I resumed, "that this young man
named Charles is but a creature of the imagination&mdash;that
he has no real existence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me," she replied; "decidedly he has
an existence&mdash;a double one. A bodily one, of which I
know nothing; and a spiritual one, of which I know
more."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked. "You have never seen him in
the flesh, but are yet acquainted with his spirit. Does
the spirit leave his body and appear to you?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so."</p>

<p>"Oh! but these are hallucinations, my dear young
lady," I said, "that patients in your state of health are
frequently subject to."</p>

<p>"No, doctor; say not so," she answered. "It is
now more than a year since, that in my dream, as I was
walking alone in a beautiful garden, I met a young man,
also quite alone and reading. He was of extraordinary
personal beauty. He looked at me a moment and
passed by. The very next evening I had the same
dream&mdash;there he was again. The dream was so very
vivid, that I could not believe it to be one of those
ordinary dreams so common to persons suffering from
indigestion. There was such a reality about the whole&mdash;the
garden, the terraces, the old house&mdash;altogether
had too much truth about it to have been a dream."</p>

<p>"And what do you think it was, if not a dream?" I
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Nothing less," she replied "than a glimpse into
that world so zealously guarded from our mortal eyes as
to make us doubt of its existence, or, at least, to hold it
as something so ethereal and visionary that we tremble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
even to speculate on it; but which, nevertheless, exists,
has existed, and will exist to all eternity in form as
palpable as the earth we this day inhabit."</p>

<p>I mused a little, then said, "Dreams are often very
vivid; I know that by experience, but upon waking I
have always been able to account for them in some way
or other."</p>

<p>"Don't call this a dream of mine, doctor," she said.
"In everything it is most unlike the dreams of your
experience. Those you allude to are vivid only for one
night, and disperse into air on waking. Such is not the
case with my dreams. The dream of each night to me
is the continuation of the dream of the preceding
night, and this has been regularly going on for more
than a year, each dream being crowded with a series of
events such as would be sufficient to fill up a lifetime;
and so vivid, indeed, is the colouring of everything in
these visions, that I no more doubt in a double
existence than that I am talking to you at the present
moment. In awaking, too, I find, that instead of
vanishing like an ordinary dream, I bear ever afterwards
the strongest recollection of everything that has
happened during my period of sleep."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "It is very strange. I am
just attending a young man in London who shares your
complaint. The case is a rare one; I never came across
one before at all like it. The coincidence about the
whole affair is so strange, too. His name happens to
be Charles, and whilst talking in his sleep as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
tell me you do, I have heard him mention the name
Edith. Your name, is it not?"</p>

<p>"'Tis he! 'Tis he!" exclaimed my patient, enthusiastically,
throwing up her arms and clasping her hands
above her head. "I knew it, I knew it! But tell me
more about him, doctor! I did not see him last night,
and I was so unhappy. The night before he appeared
to me less distinct than he had ever done before. Oh,
doctor," she cried, in an agonising tone, "you are
<i>curing</i> him, you are <i>curing</i> him!" much in the same
way as she might have called out, "You are <i>killing</i>
him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope to some day. There is no great harm
in that, I suppose?" I remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed!" she cried; "you are imprisoning
his spirit within his body, and I shall never see him
again."</p>

<p>"Well," I thought to myself, "this is about the
oddest courtship <i>I</i> ever heard of; but," I continued,
aloud, "supposing I could cure you both; then, afterwards,
you might meet in the flesh; and how much
better that would be. You would preserve your health
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried. "Do you think our joys could
be half so intense, so ethereal, in a fleshly life as when
walking in the spirit? No, doctor, have mercy upon
both of us, and leave us to die; we shall then be all
spirit."</p>

<p>"Charles' sentiments exactly," I muttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they not?" she said, brightening up. "He, then, has let
you into the secret of this phenomenon of his being! Oh,
doctor," she exclaimed, "don't, don't, <i>cure him</i>!"</p>

<p>She spoke with such agony of feeling, that I could
not help feeling the deepest sympathy for her, and I
actually for a moment began to waver in my duties as a
medical man. I began to think that, if, as it now appears,
two human beings, having never met in the body, are
nevertheless by some occult law of nature, permitted
to hold communion with each other in the spirit as
lovers, what cruelty in me to try and cut short their
happy time of courtship! Would it not be kinder in
me (seeing that the order of their beings differs so from
that of the rest of the herd) to go against the common
duties of my profession, and instead of trying to remedy
the malady, to accelerate it, till it resulted in death.</p>

<p>"But no," I said to myself, immediately; "my reputation,
my conscience. What! <i>I</i> a poisoner! No," I said;
"we must all die some day, and my two lover patients
must hold out in this life a little longer. Death comes
soon enough for all, and then, if their spirit love was as
lasting as it appeared to be intense, they might resume
their amours after this mortal coil was doffed. What
are a few paltry years compared with the immeasurable
gulf of eternity?" Thus I mused, but suddenly I said,
"You will not mind taking a little light physic, will
you?"</p>

<p>"What! to make me well!" she exclaimed. "To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
imprison my spirit within my body, as you have done
Charles'. But stay, if I take your physic, it will not be
yet. I will wait to see if Charles is really lost to me for
ever. If he does not appear again all this week, then
his spirit has no longer power to wander from the body,
and if he is lost to me, why should I wander about in
the spirit seeking him in vain? I might just as well be
cured as not."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said; "then, for the present it is
needless to administer any medicine?"</p>

<p>"Not at present, doctor," she said.</p>

<p>I took up my hat to go, and said that I would call
again soon and would bring her tidings of Charles; that
I was going there straight from her.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay," she said. "You have told me nothing
about him as yet."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear young lady," I said, "I really do not
know what to tell you about him. Like yourself, he
refused to take my medicine, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, he refused! Then how is it that he is getting
well? That he does not appear to me now? Doctor,
you have had something administered on the sly. I
know it. I see it in your face;" and the look that she
gave me was so penetrating, that I quite quailed under
it, and was obliged to admit that I had.</p>

<p>"And you are going to try the same trick with me.
Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>Here she groaned, and threw herself forward on the
bed in agony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Miss Edith," I said, compassionately,
"calm yourself; pray reflect. I can't, I daren't leave
you to die. Be persuaded, and take only a little harmless,
quieting medicine, not nauseous to the taste, and
which may not have the effect of making you cease
to dream."</p>

<p>But my fair patient was not to be persuaded, so,
with hat in hand, I made another step towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Stay, doctor," she said; "whatever you do, keep
our conversation secret from the people of the house."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I. "Has it not been under the
'seal of confession!'"</p>

<p>"True, true," she said; "and, doctor&mdash;would you
mind&mdash;if you are really going to call upon&mdash;Charles,
to&mdash;to&mdash;take a relic to him of me?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said. "On the contrary, I should
be most happy; but&mdash;" I said, after a moment's
reflection, "but&mdash;your parents&mdash;would they object, do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be afraid, doctor," she replied. "I am
very independent, and as for yourself, your name
needn't get mixed up in the transaction."</p>

<p>Here she reached a pair of scissors, and severed
one of her long ebony tresses, which she handed to
me with these words:</p>

<p>"Take this," she said, "to my spirit lover, and tell
him Edith sends him this in the flesh, and hopes to see
him again in the spirit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>I promised I would do as she desired, and shaking
hands with her, I left the apartment.</p>

<p>My friend and his wife awaited me in the parlour,
and asked me my opinion of their daughter's case.
I gave them hope of her recovery; but told them that
she had positively refused to take any of my medicines,
and I therefore adopted the same man&#339;uvre that I had
adopted with Charles, and was forced to leave the
medicine to be administered clandestinely. I wrote out
a prescription and left the house, saying I would call
again in a day or two. I took the mail that evening,
and started for London. Finding myself at length
arrived in the great metropolis, my first thought was to
call upon Charles.</p>

<p>As I entered his chamber the expression on my
patient's countenance was one of deepest melancholy.
When he first caught sight of me I thought he looked
suspicious, and was going to turn away, but as I
approached him his countenance altogether changed,
and grew so bright and radiant, that he did not look the
same man. He had never welcomed me before in this
way, and his manner puzzled me.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor," he cried, in tones of the greatest joy,
"is it possible you have seen her? I know you have; I
can't be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Seen who?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Come, doctor," he said "you know all about it;
don't pretend to ignore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ignore what?" I enquired, with provoking
pertinacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, doctor! you'll drive me mad," exclaimed
my patient. "Tell me all about her at once,
and keep me no longer in suspense. Oh, Edith!
Edith! I feel your presence. Come, doctor, tell me
about <i>Edith</i>."</p>

<p>"What Edith?" I exclaimed. "Are there not many
of that name? It is true I <i>do</i> come from a young lady
patient whose name <i>happens</i> to be Edith. What then?"</p>

<p>"The same! I knew it, I knew it," he cried. "Tell
me all about her, doctor; you have seen her, and
spoken to her. Oh! we may yet meet in the flesh,
even if she be denied me in the spirit. Did you tell
her of my case, doctor?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>"I told her," said I, "that I was attending a young
man whose symptoms very much resembled her own.
Oh! I had a long talk with her, I assure you; and
what do you think she wants of me?" I asked. "Why,
she was actually unfeeling enough to ask me not to cure
you; she was, indeed."</p>

<p>"My own dear Edith!" he exclaimed. "Of course
she doesn't want me cured; and, doctor, if you would
do both her and me a kindness, don't&mdash;oh, don't&mdash;cure
her."</p>

<p>"Well, you're an amiable couple, I'm fancying,"
said I. "I wonder whether there are many more such
loving couples in the world as you two."</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," he said, smiling, "have you any
more news for me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I may have," I answered, mysteriously.
"What should you say if she entrusted me with a
present to you?"</p>

<p>"A present from <i>her</i>! Oh, doctor, don't trifle with
me. Is it really so?"</p>

<p>Hereupon I thrust my hand into my pocket, and
produced the lock of hair, wrapped up in a piece of
tissue paper. He made a snatch at it with his long lean
fingers, and tearing it open, exclaimed, "<i>Her</i> hair! I
could swear to it anywhere. What did she say, doctor,
when she gave this into your hands?"</p>

<p>"She said," said I, "'Take this to my spirit lover,
and tell him Edith sends him this in the flesh, and
hopes to see him again in the spirit.'"</p>

<p>"Bless her! bless her!" he cried, enthusiastically
kissing the relic repeatedly and pressing it to his heart.</p>

<p>I allowed this transport to pass well over before
I spoke again. At length I enquired how he had
passed the night.</p>

<p>"Badly," he replied, sulkily.</p>

<p>"What! have you not felt quieter, more composed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he answered; "you don't suppose that I
am ignorant that you have been drugging me?" he said,
casting at me a look of reproach.</p>

<p>"Drugging you?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes; did you think I couldn't taste that stuff that
you got my parents to give me through all its disguise?
Do you think I did not feel its influence?"</p>

<p>"A salutary influence only, I hope," I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
being forced at length to admit the stratagem that I
had felt it my duty to adopt.</p>

<p>"What you would call a salutary influence," he
retorted. "But do you know," he added, almost
fiercely, "that you have robbed me of those dreams
that constituted the better part of my life? In fact, my
<i>real</i>, my <i>only</i> life."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that," I remarked. "Do you then
not dream at all now?"</p>

<p>"If I dream, I do <i>but</i> dream&mdash;like all ordinary
mortals, but my second existence is closed, I fear, for
ever. I will tell you what I dreamt last night. I
walked towards the entrance of a beautiful garden
where I had often been in the habit of meeting Edith,
and I found the gate closed. I shook it, and tried to
open it by main force, when I noticed something
written over the gate. I read these words, 'This is
the abode of spirits untrammelled by the flesh.'</p>

<p>"I did not know other than that I was as much in
the spirit as on any of the preceding nights, so I tried
the gate again, only to meet with the same success; but
this time I heard a voice calling out, 'Thy flesh hath
grown upon thy spirit&mdash;the doors of thy soul are closed&mdash;hence!
back to earth!' I made one more desperate
effort, and called out, 'Edith! Edith!' but my voice
went forth from me weak, like a voice in the distance.
Nevertheless, my cry was answered. I heard Edith's
voice within the garden calling out my name, but in very
feeble tones. My ears were too grossly clogged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
flesh to hear distinctly spiritual sounds. I was aware of
Edith's presence. She shook the garden gate with her
hands and spoke to me through the bars, but I saw no
form. I heard only her voice.</p>

<p>"'Come to me,' she said, in what appeared a
suppressed whisper. 'Oh, what is this, Charles? Why
cannot you come?'</p>

<p>"Then the same unknown voice that had addressed
me before spoke again, 'Spirit to spirit&mdash;flesh to flesh!'
and I felt myself whirled back from the garden gate as
by a whirlwind, and I awoke."</p>

<p>"The dream is strange," I observed. "Have you
many such dreams?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Up to the present time, thank goodness, no; but
who knows if to-night I shall be able to dream at all?"</p>

<p>"You will sleep all the sounder if you don't.
Dreams always come when the sleep is disturbed,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Doctor, would you rob me of all I have to live
for by your drugs?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I should be sorry," I replied, "if my drugs have the
unfortunate effect of robbing you of pleasant dreams;
but it is my first duty as a medical man to remedy the
physical ills of my patients."</p>

<p>"Well, no more drugs for me, that's all," he said,
positively. "The next article of food I take that tastes
in the slightest degree of physic I shall certainly throw
away."</p>

<p>"In that case," I replied, "if there is no way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
administering medicine to you, this must be my last
visit. It is useless calling on a patient who refuses to
be cured."</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," he said, "I shall be sorry to lose
you, as your conversation serves to cheer my waking
death. Of course, I can't expect you to put yourself
out of the way to come here for nothing; but if at any
time you are not better employed, just drop in as a
friend."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I should not like to drop an
acquaintance so interesting. But, the subject of medicine
apart, you really must take a little more nutriment than
you do."</p>

<p>This was what was really the matter with him. The
body was worn away through insufficient diet, till the
patient was in a state bordering on starvation; and this
had been for a long time persisted in, as the invalid
found a morbid delight in those vivid dreams peculiar
to all people who practise long fasting; and so loth was
he to give up his beloved dreamland, that he was ready
to sacrifice life itself.</p>

<p>We chatted together for some time longer, and he
related to me many of his dreams, which were all of a
most extraordinary character. At length I got up to
go, saying I would call on the morrow, and entered the
parlour where the parents of the young man were seated.
They asked me how my patient progressed. I told
them he wanted plenty of nutriment, and, without
ordering further medicine, I told them to give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
plenty of mutton broth, beef tea, and other nutritious
things, and to put them as close to his bed as possible,
that the smell of the savoury food might awaken his
appetite.</p>

<p>They promised to comply with my request, and I
quitted the house. I had one or two other cases to
attend to after that, which interested me in a much less
degree, after which I returned home, and committed to
paper the leading peculiarities of the cases of Charles
and Edith.</p>

<p>In the course of the morrow I called again upon
Charles. I thought he looked better. There was
certainly a change in him since my first visit.</p>

<p>"Well," I asked, "and how did you sleep last
night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor!" he answered, "such a dream!"</p>

<p>"Well, come, what was it?"</p>

<p>"I thought," he began, "that I was again in search
of that garden gate that I have before alluded to, but
when I came in sight of it it was no longer distinct and
tangible as on the preceding night, but misty in outline,
and as I approached it seemed to recede and grew more
misty, as if I saw it through a fog. The fog grew more
and more dense, like an immense black cloud, and I
saw nothing. Then the cloud seemed to solidify, and
it turned to a solid wall of stone, and I found myself
suddenly enclosed within what looked like the courtyard
of a prison. I looked out for some loophole, but
all attempt at escape appeared impossible. My eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
soon caught an inscription on the wall, which ran thus,
'The boundary of the body.'</p>

<p>"'What,' I said, within myself, 'can my spirit no
longer soar into those blissful realms it was wont
formerly to revel in? Must I tamely submit to this
imprisonment without one effort? No,' I said; 'never
will I basely give in thus.' And, noticing a wide chink
between the stones, I placed the tip of my foot in. I
soon found another notch for my fingers. There was
no one near, so, finding higher up another chink, I put
the other foot in that, and after considerable difficulty
and danger, succeeded in reaching the top of the wall.
I found that the prison was built on a high rock in the
middle of the sea, and guarded by demon sentinels.</p>

<p>"I looked out into the distance. There was nothing
but sea and sky, and that, too, seemed so blended
together as to appear all one element. In whatever
direction I chanced to gaze, all was vast, infinite,
indefinable.</p>

<p>"'Yonder must be the realms of the spirit,' I
muttered to myself, as I lolled upon the summit of the
prison wall. The words I uttered fell upon the ear of
a demon sentinel below, armed with a long halberd.
He raised the alarm, and I was forced to descend from
my perch. Finding myself once more in the prison
yard, I heard rapid footsteps behind me, and the
jingling of keys. I turned round suddenly and beheld
the jailor.</p>

<p>"'What is this place?' I asked, somewhat sternly,
'and why am I here?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"'This building,' answered the jailor, 'is called
<i>the prison-house of flesh</i>, and the reason you are here is
that you belong to "our sort."'</p>

<p>"I groaned, and followed the jailor, who led me
below into some horrid cell, where the daylight scarce
entered. He turned the key upon me and I awoke."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said I, "that was a very disagreeable
dream. There was nothing about Miss Edith in that,"
I said, smiling wickedly.</p>

<p>"No," he said, savagely, "and whose face do you
think the jailor's was in my dream?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," I replied.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>yours</i>, doctor!" said the young man, suddenly
starting up with extreme energy, and darting a
look of ferocity towards me.</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, you are my jailor; it is you who
have closed my spirit up in its prison-house of flesh, so
that it can no longer soar together in the company
of the higher intelligences. It is you who have driven
me back again to earth and made me an equal of such
minds as your own. <i>You</i> have robbed me of the only
woman I ever loved in my life, <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, young man, one moment," I said, "and
calm yourself. Is this your gratitude for the relic I
brought you yesterday? If I, as you say, have robbed
you of one of your lives, don't I offer you another
which to a young man of your age and position is
a state of existence that I can't say how many would
<i>envy</i>, and which, after all, is doing nothing more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
my duty as a medical man. Then, as to robbing you of
the lady you love, haven't I the power of making you
acquainted with her some day in the flesh, if all goes
well, and I succeeded in curing you both?"</p>

<p>"If such a meeting should take place, do you
think," he said, "that we should experience in the
same intense degree those chaste joys of love, as if we
were in the spirit, when our souls, unfettered from any
particle of clay, are raised to that sublime pitch that we
are enabled to understand the profound and lofty
discourse of angels and become ourselves for the time
a part of the heavenly bodies?"</p>

<p>"My dear young man," I observed, "life is short.
If the paradise you are in the habit of entering in your
dreams be indeed that place where all good souls hope
to go after death, you have but to wait for a few
years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a few years!" he exclaimed, impatiently,
"when every minute spent away from <i>her</i> appears a
century! It's very plain <i>you</i> are not in love."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," I said, "content yourself with
a life of flesh like any other rational mortal."</p>

<p>He began to reflect upon my words, so I thought I
would improve the opportunity, and, if possible, try and
make him turn human, so I observed,</p>

<p>"I shall not be here to-morrow; I am going to visit
Miss Edith. Shall I take her any message?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, doctor, certainly, by all means; that is,
I'll write. Give me some paper, pen and ink."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Having handed him these materials, he sat up in
bed and penned an epistle to his lady-love in the flesh,
which he sealed and handed to me.</p>

<p>I assured him of its safety in my hands, and took my
leave of him for some days, hoping to find him more
reconciled to humanity on my return.</p>

<p>Having given the parents of Charles further instructions
with regard to their son, I took my departure,
and shortly afterwards taking the stage, was <i>en route</i> for
my friend's country seat, where I arrived early the next
morning.</p>

<p>"And how is our patient?" I asked, as I shook
hands with my friend at the threshold.</p>

<p>"I fancy she sleeps sounder, doctor," he replied. "We
are not so often disturbed by her talking in her sleep."</p>

<p>"Good," said I; "her nerves will be getting a little
stronger. Can I see her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; walk straight to her room."</p>

<p>As I entered, my patient was sitting up in bed,
reading.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, after the customary salutations,
"we are better this morning, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, is that you? I am glad you have
come."</p>

<p>"What book is that?" I asked, at the same time
looking at the title. "Ah! Shakespeare. That is Charles'
favourite author."</p>

<p>"I know it, doctor. Oh, how often have we read it
together; but now, alas!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why alas?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Ah, doctor," she replied, shaking her head slowly,
"I never see him now. You are curing him, and me,
too. Of what value to me is a body in perfect health,
when it imprisons within it a wounded soul?"</p>

<p>"Come, let me see if I can't bring some balm to
the wounded soul," I said, producing from my pocket
Charles' letter.</p>

<p>"From him?" she exclaimed. "Oh, doctor, I shall
be for ever grateful to you. I dreamt I received a
letter from him last night. How is he&mdash;better? Stay,
let me read."</p>

<p>She tore open the letter and read in an undertone,
just loud enough for me to hear:</p>

<p>"Angel of my dreams&mdash;Charles in the flesh pens
thee these poor lines, greeting. How art thou, now
shut from me! The doors of the body have closed
upon my spirit, and I feel that I no more belong to the
same order of beings as a few nights ago. For me
now thou may'st wait in vain in the garden, by the
trysting tree, in the wild forest, by the sea shore, in the
desert, by the foaming cataract, on the bleak mountain
top, or by moonlight on the crags of the wild glacier,
wherever the wings of thy spirit may carry thee. I
cannot follow thee. I linger in chains of clay, and
languish from day to day in my prison-house of flesh,
whilst thou&mdash;&mdash; But, stay, perhaps the lot I bear may be
thy own; perhaps the doors of the flesh may have closed
upon <i>thy</i> spirit also. Oh, if it be that our souls are for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ever banished from that Paradise which they have so
often revelled in together! What have we further to look
forward to but those earthly joys known to the most
grovelling mortal? This is a melancholy prospect, my
Edith, for us who remember (however, indistinctly&mdash;from
the growth of that clay&mdash;over <i>thy</i> spirit perchance,
as well as my own) those divine joys we experienced
together when our spirits walked untrammelled from our
bonds of clay and our souls melted into the harmony of
those spheres which are their proper element. How
the weight of this mortal coil oppresses me as I write!
I can think of nothing that is untainted with the gross
material nature that surrounds me. My dreams of late
confirm my horrible suspicions. When, the other night,
I sought thee at the garden gate, where enter only
spirits untrammelled by the flesh, didst thou hear that
voice that turned me away, and bid me return to earth?
Oh! Edith, let us both make another effort before it is
too late. Perhaps even now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the patient dropped her voice, and her eye
scanned the paper in silence, from which I inferred that
there was something about myself in it that she did not
wish me to know; but I had heard enough. Charles
wanted to persuade his lady-love to battle against all
my efforts to bring her round to a proper state of health,
and intended doing the same himself. Here was a
regular conspiracy&mdash;two patients already all but on the
point of death, had leagued together to starve themselves
outright, and so baffle all the doctor's efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
save them. Oh, it was downright suicide. I did not
know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>"This is the last time I'll act as Mercury between
two lovers," thought I.</p>

<p>I had a momentary thought of watching for an
opportunity to get the letter into my hands, unobserved
by my patient after she had finished reading it, and then
of crumpling it up abstractedly, and throwing it into the
fire, as it was winter and a large fire was made up in the
patient's room, thinking that the impression might wear
off her mind after having read the letter only once; but
how might not her lover's words influence her if she
were allowed to read and re-read his letter when left
alone? No opportunity, however, presented itself, for
after she had finished reading it she kissed it fervently
and placed it in her bosom and held it there, glancing
at me rather suspiciously, as I thought, as if she read
my intentions in my face; but this might have been
fancy.</p>

<p>However, I tried what I could do in the way of
argument, to show the advantage of keeping a sound
mind in a sound body, besides pointing out the probability
of her some day&mdash;perhaps before long&mdash;meeting
her lover in the flesh, and that there was no reason why
they need not eventually be happy. I talked to her
much of Charles, and hoped to see her again soon,
though I should not call so very often now, as my visits
would not be necessary. I left her, giving instructions
to her parents to administer to her all sorts of nutritious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
food, as I had done to the parents of Charles concerning
their son.</p>

<p>I let some little time pass over before I called upon
either of my lover-patients again. I at length called
upon Charles, and found him all but recovered.
Though still weak, his face had filled out considerably,
and his nerves were no longer so morbidly acute, and
his countenance had lost to a great extent that supernatural
look that characterised it on my first visit; still,
it was far from being the face of a man in robust health.
I thought him silent and reserved towards me, but when
I told him I had delivered his letter, and talked to him
of his lady-love, he brightened up a little. I told him I
should take the stage on the morrow to visit Edith.</p>

<p>He wanted me to take another letter, but I pleaded
great hurry and escaped from the house. When I saw
Edith again, she also had improved in health immensely,
thanks to the careful watching of my friend's wife,
who was like a real mother to her, and would <i>not</i> allow
her to starve herself. Seeing her so nearly recovered,
I recommended a little change of air as soon as
convenient.</p>

<p>Upon my departure Edith managed to slip a
<i>billet-doux</i> into my hand, directed to Charles; that is
to say, without address, for I had not told her where he
lived. We were not left alone on this interview, the
wife of my friend being present all the while, so the
note had to be passed into my hand clandestinely.
There was no getting out of it, and I had to deliver it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Charles as soon as I arrived in town. His eyes sparkled
when he saw her writing.</p>

<p>"Look here, what Edith says about you!" said he,
somewhat bitterly. He read as follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Charles</span>,&mdash;Your own true Edith writes
to you in the flesh by our common but well-meaning
enemy, Dr. Bleedem."</p>

<p>"There!" he said, "that's what she thinks of you."</p>

<p>"Enemy!" I cried, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, enemy; but well-meaning, you see, she says,"
he continued, in a softened tone.</p>

<p>He then continued to read:</p>

<p>"The poor man thinks, no doubt, that he has
achieved a great thing in bringing us privileged seers
into the world of spirits back into this mundane sphere,
fit only for beings of his order. Of course, what else
could be expected of him? The nature of his profession,
the grossness of his being, compel him to think
and act in the way of grovelling mortals; but let us not
be too hard upon him; he is a good man, and means
well."</p>

<p>"There!" he observed, "you see, she is charitably
disposed towards you. I don't know that I feel disposed
to be so lenient."</p>

<p>At this odd beginning of a love-letter, and still odder
allusion to myself, I fairly burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh! laugh away," he said; "it is a fine triumph to
rob two beings of the very essence of their happiness."</p>

<p>I had not done laughing, and he was nearly catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the infection. He observed in the words of his
favourite poet, that, my lungs did crow like chanticleer,
and I did laugh <i>sans</i> intermission.</p>

<p>He took up the letter again, and read a great portion
to himself, or half aloud. I caught the following
passage:</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Charles, when, in the early
days of our courtship, you used nightly to serenade me
under my window in the enchanted castle, and how long
it was before you knew that I, like yourself, had an
earthly body that had an existence of its own? And
when I told you that my parents&mdash;or rather, my adopted
parents&mdash;were not in the land of spirits, but that they
inhabited the same world in which, in the daytime, we
ourselves were forced to vegetate; and when you thereupon
asked me with whom I shared the castle, do you
remember the horror, the rage, and indignation you felt
when you heard that I was held captive within that
enchanted castle by a horrible wizard, who tortured me
and tried all his base arts to make me yield to his love?
Oh! Charles, I often look back to that time. I can see
the bold outline of that rude, massive building on a rock
frowning on the lake below. I feel myself yet at my
casement, gazing out in search of your bark, which
passed nightly close to my window, and I fancy I hear
your touch upon the lute reverberating through the
night air.</p>

<p>"With what horror I remember being torn from my
window on that night by my captor, as I was waving my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
handkerchief to you on the lake. Oh! the torture I
underwent within those unhallowed walls after you left
me; the scenes I was compelled to witness, the oaths I
was forced to hear; and then the infernal hideousness
of the countenance of my demon captor!</p>

<p>"Oh! Charles, shall I ever forget the night on
which you rode up to the wizard's castle on a spirit
charger, habited as a cavalier, and bearing a ladder of
ropes under your mantle which you reached up to me
on the point of your lance; how I descended, and you
placed me behind you on your steed and galloped
away; how, ere we were far from the castle, my flight
was discovered, and the wizard and all his demon host
mounted their demon chargers and started in pursuit of
us; how they gained on us; how we avoided them for
miles by hardly half-a-horse's length, until we arrived at
a bridge across a river of fire, over which none but the
pure in love can pass? Dost remember, Charles, how
bravely thy spirit charger bore us over in safety, and
how, when the fell magician endeavoured to follow us
with his evil crew, how the bridge tumbled to atoms,
and the demon host was swallowed up in the fiery
waves? Then how, when our charger was spent, we
turned him out to graze, the sun having risen; and how,
having arrived at the sea shore, we found a boat, which
we entered, and steered onward in search of further
adventure. How swiftly, how gallantly we sailed, as if
borne on by the good spirits, until we reached an island,
where the inhabitants welcomed us and claimed us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
their king and queen. Charles! do you remember all
this? But why call up all these reminiscences? They
are over now, and passed as a dream, and this hence-forward
must be our life. I know nothing of your life
in the flesh, my spirit lover, or what may be your social
position in this world. No matter, whatever it be, and
in spite of whatever obstacles may raise themselves to
our happiness in this vale of tears, remember that I am
ever thine in the spirit,</p>

<p class="rgt">"<span class="smcap">Edith L&mdash;&mdash;.</span>"</p>

<p>Having concluded, he folded up the letter, kissed it,
and pressed it to his heart.</p>

<p>"And do you remember all the details of that
strange adventure alluded to by Miss Edith, as having
happened to you both? Do you remember really
having taken part in this strange romance in another
phase of existence?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," he replied; "every particular of it."</p>

<p>"Strange!" I muttered, to myself. "Then these
<i>dreams</i>, as we ordinary mortals would say, are really to
such beings as yourself <i>facts</i>&mdash;phases of another existence,"
I remarked.</p>

<p>"Precisely so," said he.</p>

<p>"Then your being king of an island was no mere
phantasy," said I; "but as much a fact&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As much a fact as that while in the flesh I am a
poor devil," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I never thought I should have a royal
patient," I observed, smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "now do you see the extent of the
wrong that you have done me? You have robbed me of
a kingdom in bringing me back to health."</p>

<p>"Many a sick monarch would be glad to exchange
his kingdom for good health," I retorted.</p>

<p>This was almost my last visit to Charles. I <i>did</i> call
again, but it was long after he had completely recovered.</p>

<p>Months passed away, when one day I casually met
Charles in the streets. He had quite recovered, and
was looking very well. He had much to tell me, so, as
I had a little spare time on hand, we strolled into the
park, and being a hot day, we sat down together beneath
the shade of a tree in a solitary spot. He seemed to
have grown more reconciled to humanity, having now
only a dim recollection of the intensity of the joys
he used to experience in his dreams. I touched upon
the subject nearest his heart, and he commenced a
recital of all that had happened to him since we last
met. I shall endeavour to give his own words as nearly
as possible.</p>

<p>"You will remember, doctor," he began, "that you
left me without giving me the address of Miss L&mdash;&mdash;"
(Edith took the surname of my friend the squire, as if
she were his own daughter, her real name being
unknown). "I called upon you afterwards on purpose
to inquire, and was informed that you were out of town.
I had no one now to apply to for information, and was
in despair. I did not know what to do with myself in
town during the summer, so I thought I would try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a little country air. I loitered about first in one
country place, then in another, without any fixed
purpose. I had been reading Shakespeare one day,
and upon closing the book, I resolved I would take a
pilgrimage to the birth place of the great Swan of Avon.</p>

<p>"I had never yet visited this retreat, so I started at
once, and determined to put up in the village for some
time. With what a thrill of delight, awe, and enthusiasm
I crossed the threshold of that humble domicile! <i>His</i>
foot had once crossed that same spot! Here was the
window that <i>he</i> used to look out of. The identical
glass, too, all carefully preserved by a network of wire.
<i>His</i> table and <i>his</i> chair! There was something magical
to me in that low-roofed chamber, with its old-fashioned
beams.</p>

<p>"This, then, was the birthplace of that giant brain
destined to illumine the world with the rays of his
genius! Who knows how many plays had been conceived
and worked out within those four walls? To
me, the spot was hallowed ground. <i>I</i> could not
inscribe my name on those sacred panels. It seemed
almost sacrilege for me to sit down in his chair, but I
did so; and begged to be left alone for a time, that I
might meditate on the life and genius of the greatest
of poets.</p>

<p>"It was not without a feeling of regret that I tore
myself away from this hallowed shrine. I wandered
through the almost deserted streets, and read the
names over the village shops. 'William Shakespeare'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
here caught my eye; 'John Shakespeare' there;
descendants, no doubt, of the great poet. Shakespeare
seemed a common name here. I wondered whether
any of them inherited his genius. No matter, it would
be something to say that one was descended from
so great a man, without possessing any further
recommendation. I called upon a certain William
Shakespeare, and inquired into his pedigree. He
seemed a very ordinary sort of personage. He did not
appear to know, nor yet to care much, if he were really
descended from the bard or no. There was no genius
about <i>him</i>. I called upon another, and then another,
bearing the name of the poet, but could not discover
the slightest spark of the fire that kindled the soul of
the great dramatist in any one of them. I strolled on
to the church, and visited the tomb. A sensation of
awe crept over me as I read the simple couplet
engraved over the vault containing the ashes of the
bard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blessed be he who spares these stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cursed be he who moves my bones.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I shuddered to think of the awful consequences
that might ensue to the sacrilegious hand that should
dare move his honoured dust. There was his effigy
placed within a niche in the wall of the church, high up
above the heads of the congregation, and gave the idea
of being placed in a sort of pulpit. The bust was but
a rude work of art, but it had the reputation of being
the only authentic likeness of the poet; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
it was with intense interest that I scanned the features.
I fancied that I could descry, in spite of the rude workmanship
of the stonemason, certain lines about the
mouth and eyes that indicated that droll humour displayed
in his comedies. I stood rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>"Around me were the tombs of the Lucy family;
close to the poet's own dust the graves of his wife and
daughter. But let me hasten to the more important
point in my narrative.</p>

<p>"After I left the church I was shown the dead of
the Lucy family, and obtained permission to wander
over the grounds. 'In that house,' I said to myself,
'lives the lineal descendant of that squire before
whom the bard was brought for poaching, and whom
afterwards he is supposed to have caricatured under
the title of "Justice Shallow."'</p>

<p>"I wandered alone through the forest of Arden,
and seemed to imbibe inspiration from the surrounding
scenery. I called up scenes from 'As you like it,'
and other plays. I sat down on the grass in a wooded
spot, and watched the deer.</p>

<p>"'Here,' I thought, to myself, 'must be the spot
where the melancholy Jacques moralised on the
wounded deer. Yonder, perhaps, where he met the
fool in the forest.' I mused awhile, and then opened
my Shakespeare at the scene of Rosalind and Celia,
followed by Touchstone, and became deeply engrossed.</p>

<p>"I might have been half-an-hour poring over this
scene, when I lifted my eyes from my book and beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
coming towards me in the distance the slim and
graceful form of a lady, reading a book which was
bound in the same fashion as the book I was reading,
and which, therefore, I concluded must be a Shakespeare.
She approached with her eyes still fixed on
the book. At length, as I gazed on her she closed
the book, and her eyes met mine.</p>

<p>"'Edith!' I cried, 'do I dream still, or is it
indeed yourself in the flesh?'</p>

<p>"She was no less surprised than myself.</p>

<p>"'Charles!' she exclaimed, 'how have you tracked
me hither? Did you know of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Tracked you, Edith!' I exclaimed. 'I knew
nothing of your whereabouts. This is the hand of Fate.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Charles, is it possible!' she cried. 'To think
that we should live to meet in the flesh.'</p>

<p>"We embraced, and strolled under the trees
together.</p>

<p>"'Shall I awake from this,' I kept saying to myself,
'and find it also a dream?'</p>

<p>"We both of us began to doubt whether we were
sleeping or waking. She informed me that her adopted
parents, for she was a foundling, as I learnt, had taken
her with them, away from home for the summer for
change of air; and, as she had often expressed a wish
to visit the spot where she had been first picked up by
her present parents when a baby of a week old, she
begged Squire and Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash; to take her to Stratford-on-Avon,
a place of double interest to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"She invited me to her house, and introduced me
to the squire and his lady, who both remarked how
much we resembled each other in feature. I frequented
the house much, and Edith and I were in the habit of
taking long walks together. It is hardly necessary to
say that I was not introduced as the young man Edith
used to meet in her dreams. The tale would have
been too startling, and would not have been credited;
and yet Edith had been so entirely under the surveillance
of her parents, that it was impossible for her to
have formed an acquaintance with anyone without their
knowledge, so I had to trump up some story&mdash;indeed,
I scarce know what&mdash;about rescuing her from a bull,
just to account for our acquaintance.</p>

<p>"We were left much alone. Little did the parents
think what an old attachment ours was; and for a long
time I thought the squire looked favourably on my suit,
but when matters were advanced so far that I demanded
her in marriage, he drew up stiffly, and inquired into
the state of my finances. I boasted of my family, but
was obliged to own that as far as money-matters went,
I was afraid that by my own fortune I could hardly
hope to keep his adopted daughter in that style to
which she had been accustomed.</p>

<p>"He hummed and hawed; but Edith broke in,
begged and wept, saying she had never loved before,
and vowed that she never would love another. At
length the squire, with some reluctance, gave his consent,
but said that I must find something to get my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
own living, and I am consequently looking out for some
mercantile employment.</p>

<p>"'To such base uses must we come at last,'" he
quoted, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "rather a come-down from a king;
but, never mind what it is, as long as it pays well."</p>

<p>I saw him wince at this speech of mine; his
romantic nature revolted against all thoughts of making
money, however pressing his needs might be.</p>

<p>We parted, and I called upon him about a week
after, when I found he was making grand preparations
for his marriage. He informed me that he had got his
eye upon some appointment, but that he should have to
wait. There was a certain air of sadness about his face
still. He did not look like a man about to be married.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said he, "do you know what I have been
thinking of late?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that this marriage of mine
will never come off," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked. "Have you had some lovers'
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why, then? Has the squire changed his mind,
after having given his consent?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"No; nor that either," he replied. "I cannot
myself give you my reason for the fancy&mdash;it is a presentiment.
You know, 'the course of true love never
<i>did</i> run smooth.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, soothingly, "that is your fancy; you
are nervous and impatient&mdash;it is natural."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said; "I am sure of it&mdash;I feel it."</p>

<p>"What! Have you been dreaming that it would
not?"</p>

<p>"No; I never dream now," he replied.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," I observed; "it is a good
sign. When does the wedding take place?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow was the day appointed, but it won't
take place, I say. Mark my word."</p>

<p>"So soon! But what can have put it into your
head that it will not take place to-morrow? Do you
know of any impediment likely to occur between this
and then?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "none for certain, but I tell you,
once for all, it will not take place."</p>

<p>I did not know exactly what to make of this strange
monomania. My suspicions were again aroused as to
the brain being affected. I did not see what could
happen to hinder the marriage, so I left him, after
cheering him as much as I possibly could, determining
within myself to call upon him as soon after his marriage
as was convenient, to triumph over him and laugh at
his presentiments; but this was the last time I ever
saw Charles.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, my last, visit I was glancing rapidly
over the paper at breakfast when I was shocked to see
among the list of deaths the name of Charles &mdash;&mdash;, aged
twenty-four. Strange enough; I had been dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of him much the night previous. What was my surprise
and dismay when, looking lower down the column, I
saw also the death of Edith L&mdash;&mdash;. I looked at the
date of both deaths. To my still further surprise, both
lovers had departed this life at exactly the same hour&mdash;at
midnight, October 12th, 17&mdash;.</p>

<p>"What a strange coincidence," I thought. "What
strange beings both of them were! They did not
appear either to belong to or to be fitted for this world.
They were evidently never destined for an earthly lot
together."</p>

<p>"The hand of providence is in this," I muttered.</p>

<p>I grieved much for the loss of my two patients, for I
had conceived quite a fatherly affection for them both.
As soon as decency would permit, I called upon the
parents of Charles. The account they gave of the
reason of his death caused me no little surprise. It
appeared that on the eve of his marriage his mother
received a badly-written and ill-spelt letter from a
person who professed to have known the family a long
time, begging her to call upon the writer, who was then
in a dying state, and had an important communication
to make.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, curious to know who the writer could be,
called at the address given in the letter, which proved
to be a miserable hovel in one of the back slums of
London. There, stretched upon a wretched pallet, lay
the squalid and emaciated form of an old woman,
whom, after some difficulty, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; recognised as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
monthly nurse who attended her four and twenty years
ago, during her confinement.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Look at me. Do you recollect me now?"
inquired the hag.</p>

<p>"How should I? I never saw you before. Stay,
your features seem to grow more familiar to me, now
my eyes get accustomed to the light. Is it possible
you can be Sarah Maclean, the midwife who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The same," responded the hag.</p>

<p>"What would you of me?" inquired Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"I have a communication to make before I die,"
said the old woman. "Listen."</p>

<p>And she began her confession in feeble tones, thus:</p>

<p>"You were not aware, ma'am, that the day before
your son was born, I myself was confined with twins&mdash;a
boy and a girl. Being called upon the next day to
attend upon you, I waited to see if your child were a
male child or a female. Finding that it was a man-child,
I took advantage of the agony I saw you were in,
deeming that my act would never be discovered. I
managed to conceal my own child under my shawl, and
so contrived to substitute my child for your own."</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, gasping.</p>

<p>"Stay; hear me out. I've got more to tell,"
continued the hag. "Your own son died shortly after
you had given him birth, through my neglect&mdash;I admit
it."</p>

<p>"Murderess!" screamed Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bear with me yet awhile," said the midwife, "while
I have still breath left to confess all. I wished that
one of my children should do well in the world, and I
adopted the stratagem I have just confessed to you.</p>

<p>"As for my other child, being a girl, I was anxious
to get her off my hands as soon as possible, so I left
her at the foot of a tree near Stratford-on-Avon, where
I myself was born."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with all your other crimes,
wicked woman?" exclaimed Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;. "They rest between
yourself and your Maker.
Spare me further confession."</p>

<p>"Stay awhile yet," said the old woman, in still
feebler tones. "My second crime concerns you
perhaps in scarce a less degree than my first. My
daughter, as I heard afterwards, was picked up by a
certain Squire L&mdash;&mdash;, and, having no children of his
own, it is likely he will make her his heiress."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;; "then Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, who
is engaged to my son&mdash;at least to&mdash;to is, in fact, your&mdash;your
daughter? Then they are twin brother and
sister!" and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; fell back in hysterics.</p>

<p>"Wretch! Infamous woman!" cried Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,
scarcely recovered from her fit. But when she gazed
again at the withered form before her, behold the evil
spirit had left its tenement. Sarah Maclean was no
more.</p>

<p>When Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; returned home, she communicated
the mournful tidings to Charles and Edith, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
together at the time&mdash;tidings which, of course, put a
stop to their union.</p>

<p>They both received the news in a state of stupefaction.
Neither wept. Their grief was too deeply seated
to give vent to itself in tears. They could not, after
having loved each other as they had loved, look upon
each other in the light of brother and sister, and as
their union was impossible, they agreed that it would
be better to part at once and for ever. They embraced
and parted, each vowing never to love again. That
night both were stricken with a violent fever, and on
the night of October 12th, at the midnight hour, the
spirits of both lovers were released from their mortal
tenements. Let us hope that they are now at rest!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two years after the death of Charles and Edith,
finding myself in the neighbourhood of my old friend
Squire L&mdash;&mdash;, I called at the house. He was glad to
see me, as usual; but I thought he looked very much
aged. The death of his adopted daughter, whom he
loved tenderly, had been a great blow to him. I
should not have liked to touch upon a subject so
painful, had he not broached the matter first himself,
and asked me if I had heard of the circumstances that
led to the death of Edith and her lover. I replied that
I had heard all from Charles' mother.</p>

<p>"And who do you think that Edith and Charles
turned out to be?" he asked. "Why, lineal descendants
of the great bard of Avon," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it indeed so?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "after the death of my poor Edith
I was curious to know something about her real mother.
I made inquiries into her pedigree, and the report I
heard from more than one quarter was&mdash;well, it is a long
story; and, at some future time, when we are not likely
to be interrupted, I may relate it to you. Suffice it to
say, that the descent of Charles and Edith may be distinctly
traced from our great Bard, William Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Strange," I observed. "It is not impossible that
some of the great poet's genius might have run in the
veins of Charles. He always impressed me as a young
man of great intellect. He might have been something
had he lived."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied my friend; "I am certain of it.
He was a very promising young man; and there was
Edith, as full of genius as she could be, poor child. I tell
you, doctor, it was marvellous what that girl had in her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe it," I said. "There was something
extremely intelligent in her expression, if I may use the
word; perhaps I ought to say, intellectual and poetical.
Well, genius, though seldom inherited from father to
son, rarely dies out of the family altogether, but often,
after lying dormant for generations, breaks out again
in some form or another, like certain diseases."</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor," said my friend; "I have observed
the fact myself, and how seldom do we find genius
unaccompanied with disease. Do you know, doctor, I
often thank Heaven that I am no genius?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>Containing Mr. Parnassus's Poem, The Glacier
King.</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of Dr. Bleedem's narrative he
was highly complimented by his audience, and various
were the comments upon his recital. The chairman
declared himself unable to decide as to which of the
two stories related that evening was the more marvellous.</p>

<p>The host of the "Headless Lady" vowed he had
never heard such a tale in all his life before, though
he knew a good story or two himself. Mr. Oldstone
proposed the health of the doctor, which was drunk
accordingly, amid cheers. He responded to it in a
short speech, when the old Dutch clock in the corner
struck one. The president rose and addressed the club
thus:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we have listened to two most interesting
stories; but time flies&mdash;the clock has announced
the commencement of another day. I regret that, on
account of the length of the first two narratives, we
shall be prevented from hearing a story from everyone;
yet I should be loth to break up this very pleasant
meeting without hearing <i>one</i> more recital. I propose,
however, that, in consideration for some of our worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
guests&mdash;the gallant captain, to wit, and our comic friend
here, who, as you see, gentlemen, appear somewhat
overwhelmed under the all-inspiring influence of the
punch&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;that the next narrative be of shorter
duration than the two preceding.</p>

<p>"According to order, the next tale ought to proceed
from Professor Cyanite."</p>

<p>Then, turning towards the professor, he inquired if
he had a story ready that would not take too long in
the recital.</p>

<p>"Well, chairman," said the professor, "the fact is
that I had prepared somewhat a lengthy one for our
meeting. At present I can't think of one sufficiently
short to wind up the evening."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the chairman, "perhaps Mr.
Blackdeed will be able to favour now."</p>

<p>Mr. Blackdeed begged to be excused. He said he
could not think of one at all. He hoped, however, to
have one ready for the next evening.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" said the chairman; "this is really
a very bad state of affairs. Has no one some short
story ready? Mr. Parnassus, cannot you favour the
company?"</p>

<p>The young poet, blushing slightly, replied, "I
thought of bringing before the company this evening&mdash;or,
rather, last evening, I ought to say&mdash;a curious little
incident out of my own experience, which occurred to
me when travelling in Switzerland a few years ago. I
have put it into verse in the form of a ballad. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
long, and if it will not weary the company, I shall be
most happy to sing it."</p>

<p>"A song, a song!" cried many voices at once.
"Bravo, Parnassus! Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>"The title of the ballad I am about to sing to you,
gentlemen, I propose calling 'The Glacier King.'"</p>

<p>"Good," said the chairman. "Silence, gentlemen,
if you please. A song from Mr. Parnassus."</p>

<p>A dead silence ensued, and the poet, after clearing
his throat once or twice, began in a clear, rich voice
the following ballad:&mdash;</p>

<h4>The Glacier King.</h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 31em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In youth, when I mid mountains roamed, full well I can recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fearful night. The pale moonlight shone on the glaciers tall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wandered from my ch&acirc;let's hearth (the world was locked in sleep),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something on my bosom made my soul a vigil keep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wandered on, I recked not where, for I was sad of mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until upon the basement of a glacier grim I stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon peeped out behind the clouds, the scene was strange and weird&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sheeted ghosts those icy rocks above me now appeared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I cared not if I lived or died; my soul was sunk in gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd little left to live for then; I almost sought my doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We die but once," I inly said. "Death's certain, soon or late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I would just as lief it came, as still protract my fate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I crunched the snow beneath my feet, and little recked of fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trod the giant pinnacles (the night grew dark and drear),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet onward recklessly I strode, nor cared which way I went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until across this sea of ice appeared a mighty rent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A horrid chasm, with below the torrent's deafening sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the madness of despair I cleared it with a bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little onward still I stood (the scene was weird and grand),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous cavern wrought in ice by Nature's playful hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Its dripping arches overhung the cataract beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its pendant massive icicles appeared like dragon's teeth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lost in contemplation of this fearful yawning cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deemed its chilly arches the recesses of the grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Anon the cave appeared when moonbeams would its depths illume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairy hall of diamond, anon, a ghastly tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I mused in phantasy, forgetting half my woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wondered whether elves or ghouls their revels held below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My blood ran chilled within my veins, a tremor shook my frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, mingled with the torrent's roar, unearthly voices came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile I listened breathlessly, as louder still they grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The icy cave's inhabitants for ever nearer drew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But one deep voice above the rest, in stern commanding tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That echoed through the cavern's walls, cried, "Silence, and begone."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, terrified, I scarce had time upon my feet to spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, robed in icy majesty, there stood the Glacier King.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A mantle of the drifted snow bedecked his regal frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his head a crown of ice, his sceptre of the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hair and beard were icicles, his visage stern and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes like glacier caverns sunk, with look that made one quail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With terror rooted to the spot, with fright uprose my hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on me, as in wonderment, he fixed an icy stare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he ope'd his lips and spake, in deep sepulchral tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What seekest thou, stranger, in our realm, a night like this alone?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I know not what I answer made, with voice below my breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When nearer, with majestic stride, he came, and thus he saith&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou 'rt welcome to our palace cold; it is full many a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since one of thy mortal race hath wandered past this way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He led me kindly by the hand. But, oh! that hand of ice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt benumbed all over, but he held me like a vice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with his sceptre tapped a door, which opened with a bang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While through the cavern's icy halls infernal laughter rang.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He led me down by steps of ice, hewn in the solid rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halting at a portal, with his sceptre gave a knock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door of ice was opened by a figure grim and grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bowed in deepest reverence, then onward led the way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We entered then the hall of state, where stood the icy throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courtiers on our entrance bowed as if to gods of stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hair hung dank about their forms, the wildest ever seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their raiment dripping icicles, their bodies of sea green.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then out and spake the Glacier King, "Make haste and bring a light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal from the outer world will sup with us to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let supper be in readiness at once without delay."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The menials made obeisance, and hastened to obey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then soon the hall of banqueting we entered, when, lo! there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lofty cavern lighted up with phosphorescent glare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ghastly light from out a lamp suspended from a height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shed upon the icicles its dim funereal light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The table was a slab of ice, the dishes they were cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they were uncovered I shuddered to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some were human corpses that had perished in the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the glacier's crevices had met their fate below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My heart then sank within me, and I from the table turned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guests all looked in wonderment, that I their dishes spurned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King then turned upon me. "Though our dishes you decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must not leave this hall to-night before you taste our wine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He bid a menial near to fill a goblet to the brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he filled a ghastly smile played o'er his features grim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King then raised it to his lips, and first a draught drank he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant goblet carved in ice he handed then to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I seized the beaker in my hand, and raised it to my lip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cautiously I tasted it, although 'twas but a sip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I laid the crystal down in haste, as horrified I stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liquor that the goblet held I found was <i>human blood</i>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King of Ice he marvelled, and his brow grew grave and stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eye would seem to ask me, "Dost thou thus my favour spurn?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trembled, for I noticed when the icy monarch frowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reflection of his countenance upon the court around.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each drew a pointed icicle from out an icy sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wore as daggers at their sides&mdash;for fear I scarce could breathe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brandishing them high aloft, while as their hands they clenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They vowed that such gross insult should not pass unavenged.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ho! sheath your daggers," quoth the king. "Once more our guest we'll try.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Base mortal! if thou still refuse to drain yon goblet dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dread our fell displeasure, for by our crown we vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of Glaciers ne'er is mocked by mortals such as thou."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I seized the goblet once again, and in despair did quaff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now through the banquet hall resounds a wild unearthly laugh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nauseous fluid seemed to burn like fire through my veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt intoxication stealing o'er me for my pains.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I fell down in a stupor, know not how long I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when my eyes were opened 'twas past the break of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King and court had vanished, but around me I descried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A troop of tourists, who that morn the glaciers would bestride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They asked me how I came there, how I could be so mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone to scale the glaciers, upon a night so bad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told them shortly all my tale&mdash;all I had got to tell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the awful Glacier King, down in his icy cell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They smiled, and said it truly was a very fearful <i>dream</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I vowed all that had happened like truth to me did seem.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They asked me to point out to them the grotto that I saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gazed around me, and behold the grotto was no more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whether it was dream or not, I know not to this day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis strange the grotto in a night should all have thawed away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I spoke about the cup I quaffed the cave beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>That was my brandy-flask</i>," quoth one, "<i>I forced between your teeth</i>."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Else you had perished in the snow, in truth, you looked far gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas by the greatest chance on earth we found you here at dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought you dead, but still I plied my flask, and, as you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has proved worthy of its name, immortal 'Eau-de-Vie.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I thanked them for their courtesy, but when I strove to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No muscle of my rigid frame could I, to my surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much as put in motion. My bones seemed on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to my ch&acirc;let's fire-side had to be carried back.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas long ere I recovered my wonted life and strength;<br /></span>

<p>Hardly had the poet concluded his lay, when the
cheering and clapping of hands that ensued half-deafened
all present; that is to say, with the exception
of two individuals&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the worthy captain and our
friend the comedian, who had been deaf for some time
past, under the kindly influences of the punch.</p>

<p>To say that the health of the poet was drunk with
three times three would be unnecessary. We leave
that to the imagination of the reader. Not only was
that conventional ceremony gone through, but the
chairman, after a short complimentary speech, proposed
that a crown of laurels should be made and the young
poet crowned therewith there and then.</p>

<p>The poet modestly interposed, but the command of
the president, especially on such an occasion as the
present, was not to be recalled. John Hearty, of the
"Headless Lady," was sent outside, snowing hard as
it was, to gather some laurel from a bush which grew
close to the inn, and the poet was crowned with all due
honours. There were two, however, who did not
witness the imposing ceremony. Who these two were
we will leave our readers to guess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The fumes of the punch had thrown the ideas of
these two worthies into another channel, and the
reverie into which they had fallen was so deep as to
render them perfectly unconscious of all that was going
on around them.</p>

<p>The captain was the first to recover from his
meditations.</p>

<p>"Ease her! Stop her!" he cried, awaking with a
yawn.</p>

<p>Then, glancing round at the company, his eye first
caught sight of the poet's brow crowned with laurels.</p>

<p>"Odds bobs, messmate!" he cried, "what the
deuce have they been doing to your figurehead?"</p>

<p>"Ah! captain," said one of the members, "you do
not know what you have lost. You've missed a song."</p>

<p>"Missed a song, have I? Well, I thought someone
must have been singing; it came in my dream. But
what, in the name of Davy Jones, has Mr. Parnassus
been taking. Why, one would think he had been
taking a glass of prussic acid, to break out all over
laurel leaves like that."</p>

<p>"That," said the chairman, "is the crown awarded
to genius. Mr. Parnassus has this evening&mdash;or, I
should say, this morning&mdash;favoured us with a poem."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the captain, who was not of a
poetical nature himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the chairman, "a poem; the work
of his own pure brain, for which he has been rewarded
with the crown that now adorns his temples, a crown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
no intrinsic value, as you perceive, like the bejewelled
diadem of royalty, but which, nevertheless, has been
sought after by minds no less ambitious in the early
days of ancient history, when the love of honour alone
was a deeper incitement to the soul than the mere love
of worldly pelf, and when once obtained, was guarded
as zealously&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here our comic friend showed some signs of
returning animation. He stretched, yawned, and,
rubbing his eyes, gazed round upon the company in
bewilderment. He also fixed his eyes on the laurel
crown, and so ludicrous was the expression of wonder
on his countenance, although he did not utter a word,
that the whole company was thrown into an immoderate
fit of laughter, which completely drowned the end of
the chairman's sententious speech. The poor little
comedian got most unmercifully chaffed by each of the
company in turn, being asked gravely by one what his
opinion was of the last story; by another, whether he
liked the punch&mdash;whether it was strong enough for
him. By another wag he was offered a penny for his
thoughts; while another insisted upon hearing the story
he had been thinking of all that time, etc., etc. The
little man answered good-humouredly to all their
bantering, when the president once more thumped the
table.</p>

<p>"Captain Toughyarn," he began, "you have been
guilty at our meeting of falling asleep in the middle
of a story, and of being so engrossed in your state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of&mdash;of&mdash;What shall I say, gentlemen?&mdash;of lethargy, as
to be totally unconscious of a most spirited song that
ensued. You have raised our curiosity, however, by
telling us that the song entered into and formed part of
your dream. We would fain hear your dream, as some
slight expiation of such gross violation of etiquette."</p>

<p>"What will he say to me," thought our comic
friend, "if he doesn't let the captain escape?"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried several voices at once. "By
Jove, you're in for it too, Jollytoast."</p>

<p>"Well, chairman," said the captain, "I'm sorry I've
broken through discipline; but when a man has got
grog stowed away in his hull&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said the chairman; "but for all that
the company must hear your dream."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" shouted the company.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>The Mermaid Palace; or, Captain Toughyarn's
Dream.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;">
<span class="i0">"Come unto these yellow sands."<br /></span>
<div class="rgt">&mdash;<i>Tempest.</i></div></div>

<p>Well, messmates, I don't know whether I am
sufficiently clear up aloft to recollect all the details of
my dream; but hold hard a moment, perhaps I can.
Ah! yes; I remember now.</p>

<p>I thought I was on board my good ship, the
<i>Dreadnought</i>, which was bound for Timbuctoo. I was
seated in my cabin, making an entry in the log, when
I was aroused by a noise of shouting on deck. I
thought I would go and see what was adrift; but hardly
was I out of the cabin when, in the twinkling of a
bowsprit, I found myself pinioned.</p>

<p>The crew were in a state of mutiny, and headed
by the first mate. I was speedily lashed to the mizen,
when Ned Upaloft (that was the name of the first
mate), presenting a brace of pistols at my face, called
upon me to yield.</p>

<p>"Avast, there! Ned Upaloft," I cried; "and you,
Jack Haulaway, with the whole gang of you, and tell
me what the devil is the meaning of this mutinous
conduct."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more palaver, but yield," he cried.</p>

<p>"Never!" I answered.</p>

<p>"Then you're a dead man," he said.</p>

<p>"Fire!" said I; "you may take my life, but never
will I yield up my power to a pack of mutineers."</p>

<p>His finger was on the trigger, and the next moment
I expected to be my last.</p>

<p>I must mention that the whole of that day the
weather had been extremely sultry. A storm arose
suddenly, and the ship pitched and rolled tremendously.
All the crew were in liquor, and the helm was deserted.
At the moment I expected it was all up with me a
terrible flash of lightning struck the barrels of the
pistols, which went off of their own accord, luckily
missing me.</p>

<p>Ned Upaloft was struck blind. The crew were
sobered for a moment.</p>

<p>"Behold," said I, reaping advantage from the confusion,
"behold, how Heaven rescues her own. So
may it go with all mutineers. Look up aloft," said I
(a flight of Mother Cary's chickens just then passed
overhead.) "Look! has that no warning? What are
those but the souls of departed mariners, who have
come to beckon you to your doom?"</p>

<p>A terrific clap of thunder almost instantaneously
followed the flash, and drowned my last words. The
crew looked irresolute as to whether they should renew
their attack or throw down their arms and yield themselves
as mutineers; but they were roused by the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Jack Haulaway, the second mate, who cried out,</p>

<p>"What! are you scared at the thunder and this
man's words? Ho! there; reef the main-top-gallant
sail."</p>

<p>The crew looked up aloft and hesitated, for the top
mast threatened to snap every moment.</p>

<p>"Come, look sharp, or in two minutes we shall all
be scudding under bare poles. What! you're afraid?
Cowards that you all are. It will have to be done. I'll
go myself."</p>

<p>And up went Jack Haulaway; but hardly had he
taken in a reef, when the mast snapped, and main-top-gallant
sail, Jack Haulaway, and all were blown far
away into the sea.</p>

<p>"Behold the fate of your second commander," said
I. "Look to yourselves now, for your time is not far
off."</p>

<p>The waves were now so enormous that the vessel
was soon on her beam ends. Smash went the bowsprit
as it struck against a rock; crash, crash, went one mast
after the other, until we were literally scudding under
bare poles. It was difficult for the sailors to maintain
their equilibrium, and several fell overboard. I looked
for the first mate. He had disappeared.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors clung to the fragments of the
vessel and tried to pray, others supplied themselves
with grog, till they lost all consciousness. One of the
men came forward to me, and, unloosing me, begged
my pardon; said he bore me no malice, and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
hadn't been in liquor, he would never have joined the
gang.</p>

<p>We all shook hands, for we deemed our last hour
had come; and so, indeed, it had for most of us. In
another moment the vessel was dashed against a rock,
filled with water, and went down.</p>

<p>Some made for the lifeboat, others for pieces of
floating timber. The storm still continued with increasing
fury. The sky was black as pitch, and the waves
the size of mountains. Planks, hencoops, and other
fragments of the wreck were floating about in all directions.
Most of the crew, if not all, must have been
swallowed up by the waves, for, as I looked around me,
I saw no one. As for myself, I kept afloat on a cask
of grog, and thus I was left to the mercy of the winds
and waves. Up one wave, down another, still I held
on to my cask of grog, out of which every now and then
I'd take a drop, just to keep out the cold; then,
replacing the bung, remounted my cask, and was contented
with whatever direction the waves chose to toss
me. The lightning flashed and the thunder growled
around me.</p>

<p>It was for all the world like being inside an
immense big drum, and Davy Jones drumming outside.
As I was being dashed to and fro by the merciless
billows, I thought I heard, mingled with the dying
tones of the thunder, the sound of a harp and singing.
Could it be fancy? I listened again. No. I was quite
sure this time my ears did not deceive me. The notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
grew more and more clear, the voice more and more
distinct. Yet, who could it be? There was no land
near for hundreds of miles. It could be no mortal
harper that touched those chords. I looked around me
in wonderment, but saw nothing. At length I was
carried to the top of a tremendous wave, and as I was
sliding down the other side of it astride my cask of grog,
I perceived coming towards me from the opposite wave
a female form, beautiful as Venus, and naked to the
waist.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! it was a mermaid. Yes, there
could be no mistake. Her golden tresses fluttered in
the breeze, and every now and then I caught a glimpse
of a large dolphin-like tail of a greenish hue, that, at
every movement she made, gleamed like silver. We
could not help meeting each other; so, as I was always
gallant towards the fair sex, I saluted her. Heavens!
What eyes! What teeth! What features! But above
all, her smile.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I assure you her beauty was divine.
Talk about sentiment! But words are wanting to
express even the thousandth part of her charms.
Enough, gentlemen, that all that is innocent, virtuous,
and heavenly, was expressed in that smile she gave
me.</p>

<p>"Angel of Beauty!" I exclaimed, "whatever your
name, your parentage, your birthplace, I vow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Toughyarn, Toughyarn," said a voice within me,
"don't make an old fool of yourself. Mermaids are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
deceitful and dangerous, however beautiful, as you will
find out to your cost before long. Think of your age,
your position. Is it likely you can excite a genuine
passion in any maid? For shame, sir. How can you
appear romantic in her eyes, astride a grog cask. Only
reflect a little."</p>

<p>But I would not reflect. I stifled the voice within
me, and, abandoning myself to the impulse of my
passion, pressed my hand to my heart, and was about
to burst out afresh, when the fair one, fixing her large
deep blue eyes upon me&mdash;deep as the Mediterranean
in a calm&mdash;with a supernaturally winning smile,
addressed me thus, in tones to which the softest
music was discord:</p>

<p>"Welcome, Captain Toughyarn, to our haunts.
Welcome to the Mermaid Grotto of pearl and coral,
to my father's palace. It is long that we await you.
We have heard much of your exploits by sea, and we
are all impatient to make the acquaintance of a hero
so illustrious."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried; "you have heard of me and
expected me, O fair one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, our Sybil has prophesied your arrival
here, and your visit to our palace. Oh, she told me
many things about you that she has seen in vision.
The mutiny of your crew, your first mate struck with
blindness when about to take your life. The loss of
your second mate while reefing a sail. Your release
by one of the crew, after having been bound to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mast; the wreck of your vessel; and, finally, our
meeting, which tallies in the minutest particulars."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed, in extreme astonishment,
"all this she saw&mdash;even the grog barrel?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;everything," replied my charmer; "but
follow me, and lose no time; we all await you below."</p>

<p>So saying, she beckoned to me with the most
bewitching smile, and floundered away from me, lashing
her tail playfully as she went, and touching the chords
of her harp, sang so sweetly, so divinely, some submarine
ditty about fairy palaces, halls of coral, and
fair mermaidens, that all resistance was vain.</p>

<p>"Don't be weak, Toughyarn," said the voice again;
"resist her wiles, be deaf to her song."</p>

<p>But I was deaf only to the voice that warned me.</p>

<p>"Divine enchantress," I cried, "I will follow you
wherever you go."</p>

<p>A wave now dashed me forward till I found myself
by her side.</p>

<p>"Are you really willing to accompany me?" she
asked, with a gleam that made me feel&mdash;I don't
know how.</p>

<p>"To the utmost corners of the earth," I replied.</p>

<p>"And even to the depths of the ocean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Even there," I replied. "Anywhere, anywhere
with thee, for <i>I love thee</i>."</p>

<p>The murder was out. She heaved a sigh, and
her head sank on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Take care, Toughyarn," said the voice; "be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
warned ere it be too late." This was the last time
the voice spoke to me. It <i>was</i> too late.</p>

<p>"And do you really love me?" she asked, gazing
up into my face, her large blue eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"With all my heart and soul," I replied.</p>

<p>"And are you prepared to give me a proof of your
love?"</p>

<p>"Any proof you may desire, my angel," I answered.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I mean," she said, "would you be ready to make
a <i>very great sacrifice</i>?"</p>

<p>"Anything," I replied; "anything for thee."</p>

<p>"Generous mortal!" she exclaimed, and she sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>The sight of beauty in tears always moved me. I
was deeply touched at this outburst of grief on the part
of my charmer, and did all I could to soothe and
comfort her. I put my arm round her delicate waist;
she offered no resistance, so, clasping her to my breast,
I&mdash;I&mdash;well, gentlemen&mdash;I kissed her. The lightning
played around me; the thunder crackling, threatened to
break the drum of my ear, but I saw nothing, I heard
nothing; I was unconscious of everything around me
in that long loving kiss.</p>

<p>My lips seemed glued to hers. I thought I should
never be able to tear myself away. I felt her heart
beat violently against my waistcoat. My blood tingled
in my fingers and toes with the intensity of my passion.
I no longer felt cold, for I bore a fire within.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>When I at length removed my lips from hers, with a
prodigious smack, she fell fainting in my arms. It was
as if her whole soul had been poured forth in that one
kiss, and there was none left to re-animate the frail form.
I sprinkled some of her native element in her face, and
she recovered.</p>

<p>I petted and caressed her, clasped her again and
again to my breast, while she clung round my neck,
confessing her love for me, and begging me never to
desert her. Oh, the rapture of those moments! She
vowed that I was all in all to her, that she had never
loved before, and never should again; that she was
mine, body and soul, and that if I ever ceased to love
her, she should die.</p>

<p>She called me her own dear Toughyarn, her hero,
her "beau ideal," her lover, her husband. She said that
I was her master, and that she would be my slave for
life.</p>

<p>I vowed that I was unworthy to pick off the seaweed
that adhered to her tail. At the word "tail," she heaved
a deep sigh, and, glancing at my lower extremities, burst
into a fresh flood of tears. I was unable to account for
these weeping fits, to which she seemed subject.</p>

<p>"Some female caprice," thought I; "nothing more."</p>

<p>"What ails thee, my beloved?" I said, tenderly.
"Say why, O bewitching enchantress, do those pearl
drops continue to pay their tiny tribute to the great
ocean?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried to herself, clasping her hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
looking upward, "I feel the sacrifice is <i>too</i> great. It
will cost him dearly; but has he not promised?"</p>

<p>"Promised!" I muttered. "What is this sacrifice,
I wonder, that she requires of me? What can it be
but always to live with her in her own home, under
the sea. When once my soul is united with hers," I
reasoned, "we shall be one being. I shall be able to live
under the water as well as on <i>terra firma</i>. And what
have I to make me wish to return to land? I am a
widower without family. I've no fortune, in fact, I am
all but a ruined man, and I feel anxious to begin a
new phase of existence. The sacrifice, after all, is not
so great. What does it matter to me where I live, as
long as I can bask the livelong day in the sunshine of
such beauty?"</p>

<p>I felt that that long ambrosial kiss, the intensity of
which had so exhausted my beloved, had imparted to
me a new life. I no longer dreaded or believed in the
possibility of being drowned. I felt an intense desire to
behold the wonders of the deep, and visit those palaces
of coral and mother-of-pearl that I had so often heard
of, so seizing my beloved by the waist, I exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Come, O joy of my soul; lead me to the hall of
thy father. Let us plunge into the turbulent billows. I
thirst for thy element. I feel irresistibly drawn down
by some new power that has come over me."</p>

<p>"Follow me, then, my beloved," she said, and with
one splash disappeared beneath the waves.</p>

<p>To kick away my grog cask and plunge in after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was the work of a moment. I dived down, down,
down, till I caught up my charmer, and we both dived
together side by side. Down, down, down, deeper,
deeper, and deeper, still we dived through forests of
seaweed, startling away all sorts of curiously formed
fish and sea monsters in our rapid course.</p>

<p>I thought I should never get to the bottom. At
length, after long continued diving, I thought I descried
gleaming through the waters, the mother-of-pearl roofs
and pinnacles of various edifices; nor was I deceived,
for as I dived deeper, I could distinguish a great city,
built in a wild, weird, grotesque style of architecture,
thoroughly new to me, yet grand in design, far above
human conception.</p>

<p>There were castles on rocks, both the rock and the
castle being formed out of one immense piece of coral,
either white or red. The rock was hollowed out by
nature, and natural staircases of the same material
branched off in different directions, and led to the castle
above. There were grottoes of mother-of-pearl, bridges
of clustering and festooned coral, intermixed with
common rock, and overgrown in parts by large quaint
sea plants, which hung down in long creepers, entangling
and festooning themselves, crossing and recrossing each
other, and communicating the upper part of the city
with the lower, the town being built partly on hills, and
partly in the valleys.</p>

<p>Immense pits and hollows in what in other cities
would have been the road, appeared to lead to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
part of the city below. Crowds of the inhabitants were
seen emerging from these grottoes, and disappearing
through others. Several were seated in chariots of
mother-of-pearl and turtle-shell, drawn by some hideous
sea monster. There were mermen, bearded and
muscular, bearing in their hands tridents; troops of
mermaids of every conceivable variety of beauty, from
the blue eyes and flaxen hair of the north, to the dark,
Oriental type. Gigantic zoophytes and sea anemones
opened their petals at us from every parapet. Music
and singing was heard everywhere, and the submarine
grottoes echoed with the strains of fair mermaidens.
Groups of dancers surrounded us as we descended,
twisting their lithesome bodies into all sorts of elegant
and fantastic attitudes; beautiful mer-children sported
with the most hideous sea monsters it was possible to
conceive.</p>

<p>The city seemed wealthy, the inhabitants contented,
and yet there was little or no sign of industry amongst
them. All the houses and palaces were evidently
formed by the hand of nature, save where here and
there a window or a mother-of-pearl roof or pavement
betrayed manual skill. Money, as I ascertained, was
an article unknown to the submarines. They had few
wants, and lived peacefully among themselves.</p>

<p>As my fair bride and I swam through the streets of
this great city together, my appearance attracted great
curiosity. The children were frightened, and darted
away into some grotto hard by. I heard an old white-bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
merman, who had, doubtless, seen a great deal
in his day, call out, "A landman! a landman!"</p>

<p>I began to feel fatigued after diving so long, and
was greatly relieved when my companion halted in
front of a large portico with pillars of the most delicate
pink coral, and said, "This is my father's palace."</p>

<p>The mer-princess (for her father was no less than a
king), instead of knocking at the door, ran her fairy-like
fingers over the strings of her lyre, and wrung from
its cords such a wild and unearthly strain, that it seemed
like the distant wail of souls in purgatory.</p>

<p>The door was opened by an immense shark, standing
on the tip of his tail. He opened and shut his huge
mouth at us by way of salute, as we entered the hall,
which was paved with mother-of-pearl, inlaid with pale
coral and turtle-shell. My fair one conducted me
through many passages and corridors, the roofs and
walls of which were covered over with every sort of
curious and beautiful shell found under the sea, till at
length we entered the dais chamber of the king, and I
was introduced to his majesty, and to his serene
consort, who both received me graciously.</p>

<p>Formalities over, a richly liveried mer-attendant
announced that the royal sea-serpent, harnessed to the
state carriage, awaited their majesties' pleasure. The
mer-king affably offered me the use of his carriage,
which I gladly accepted. Their majesties, Lurline,
and myself descended the stairs, and passing the portal,
stepped into a magnificent car or chariot, formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
mother-of-pearl and turtle-shell, the wheels being of gold
and embossed all over with the most exquisite precious
stones. The coachman, or charioteer, was a stout
merman, with a trident, with which he began to goad
the enormous sea-serpent, who, rearing and plunging,
bid fair to upset us all. However, the skilful driver,
drawing the reins, made of strong seaweed, studded
with pearls, kept him in abeyance. We then visited all
the chief temples and other public buildings, and his
majesty's parks and hunting grounds, chatting all the
time pleasantly with my beloved Lurline, and after
having spent a most enjoyable day, we returned towards
evening to the palace.</p>

<p>It was the dinner hour. About a hundred harps
from below struck up a lively air, in lieu of a dinner
bell.</p>

<p>"Captain Toughyarn," said the king, "will you take
down the Princess Lurline?"</p>

<p>I bowed, and offered my arm, and we swam into the
dining hall. It was a long and lofty apartment, with
festoons of white and red coral pendent from the arched
roof. The walls were ornamented with choice shells
in patterns, and the floor covered with a matting of
plaited seaweed. The furniture was of mother-of-pearl
and turtle-shell.</p>

<p>His majesty headed the table; his royal consort,
who had come down dressed for dinner in necklaces of
immense pearls, sat opposite to him. Other members
of the blood royal, as well as some distinguished guests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
were also present. We were waited upon by sea
monsters, who handed round large open shells in their
mouths, which served as plates.</p>

<p>A saw-fish brought me a knife and fork, a porpoise
changed the plates, a dolphin entered with the larger
dishes, and a young whale handed round the vegetables,
which consisted of different sorts of seaweed. The
dinner was chiefly of fish, varied with albatross and sea
gull, the first course being oysters, by way of whetting
the appetite.</p>

<p>The king was pleased to ask me about my adventures,
so I entertained the whole dinner table with a recital of
them. The queen smiled benignantly on me, and the
beautiful Lurline gazed into my face with an expression
of the most undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>I felt myself quite the lion of the day, and had the
conversation all to myself. During the repast a bevy
of fair mermaidens swam round and round the hall,
and over our heads, pouring forth divine melodies on
the harp.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the meal his majesty entered
into the particulars of his own family history, and the
great deeds of his ancestors, which I shall not weary
your patience, gentlemen, by retailing.</p>

<p>The dinner being at an end, we left the apartment,
and the sea monsters, after devouring everything that
was left, cleared away the plates. We strolled into the
garden, which was filled with every imaginable variety
of sea plants. Some grew up like palm trees and tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ferns, others were trained up against a wall, while others
hung gracefully over the verandah of the palace, after
the manner of creepers. Large shells, filled with sand,
served as flower pots, and contained, as his majesty
assured me, plants of extraordinary rarity. I forget
their crack-jaw names.</p>

<p>A sword-fish acted as head gardener; he was
digging away with his proboscis as we entered, and a
saw-fish was raking the flower beds.</p>

<p>It was already evening, and was getting dark. The
king ordered the saloon to be lighted up, when two
lusty mermen brought the lamps, which they hung in
the corners of the apartment, and which consisted of
shells, to each of which were attached three chains of
pearls, the bowl of the lamp being filled with those
phosphoric animalcula that are to be seen at night
round the prow of a vessel when the keel disturbs them
as it ploughs its course through the ocean.</p>

<p>The saloon being lighted, musicians were called.
They were of both sexes; sturdy mermen, with gongs
and sea horns; those of the gentler sex with harps. I
was asked if I could dance, and replying that I could
after the fashion of my country, the music struck up a
merry tune, and a number of fair sirens insisted on me
joining in the dance.</p>

<p>The dance commenced; it was a curious step,
consisting of a wriggle of the upper part of the body,
and a splash with the tail. They formed a circle, each
taking hold of the other's hand, closing and widening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
several times; then letting go of hands, each dived
down head foremost, their fingers touching the ground,
flapping their tails upwards.</p>

<p>They went through all sorts of fantastic steps, which
I tried hard to imitate, and my failures were the cause
of much merriment. I was asked whether I would
favour them with a dance of my country, so I danced
the hornpipe. With this they were delighted, and
wanted it repeated. I had to dance it again, and again,
to please them.</p>

<p>Refreshments were handed round by the same sea
monsters, and the evening wound up with games&mdash;hide
and seek, blind man's buff&mdash;and other amusements.</p>

<p>The queen said she was glad to see me enjoy
myself so much. One bewitching young siren, fixing
her dark eyes upon me, and then looking down with a
sigh, said it was pleasing to see such a great hero as I
was condescending to take part in their humble games.
Another hoped that I was in no hurry to leave them, as
she was looking forward to many such pleasant evenings.
A third mermaid wished that she had been born with
legs, in order to learn the hornpipe. A fourth hoped I
should sleep well after my fatigue.</p>

<p>The party at length broke up, and as I was the lion
of the evening, I stationed myself near the door to
shake hands with all the pretty mermaids as they swam
out of the saloon. I gave a gentle squeeze to each,
and I am certain that if not all, at least the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of those young ladies, went to bed in love with me that
night. But what of Lurline? I must not forget <i>her</i>.
The fact was I did not like to be too pointed in my
attentions, lest it should excite suspicion, for as yet her
parents knew nothing of our attachment, so I appeared
rather to neglect her than otherwise.</p>

<p>Poor child! she retired to rest unhappy that night,
fancying that I had become estranged towards her. I
had no opportunity for an explanation, and after
quitting the saloon was shown to my bedroom by a
mer-servant girl.</p>

<p>The walls and ceiling of my bed-chamber were
covered over with handsome shells, the floor inlaid
with mother-of-pearl and coral, over which was a
carpet of variegated seaweed, plaited in a pattern. The
bed posts were inlaid with mother-of-pearl, agate,
lapis lazuli, and other rare stones. The mattress was
of very soft sponge, and the counterpane one broad
piece of seaweed.</p>

<p>Having undressed, I blew out the candle; that is to
say, I smashed the animalcula inside the shell that the
servant girl brought me in lieu of a candlestick, and
tucking myself up I tried to sleep, but was haunted all
night by the bright eyes of Lurline.</p>

<p>Towards morning I fell into a light sleep, from
which I was roused by the dulcet tones of a harp at my
door and the enchanting voice of Lurline singing. I
leaped from my couch, donned my clothes, and
welcomed her with a kiss on the sly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cruel one!" she said, "I thought you had ceased
to love me."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> cease to love thee, sweetest! Never!"</p>

<p>"You are quite sure you love me, then?" she said.
"And you will never desert me?"</p>

<p>"Desert thee! my angel," said I. "Do you think
I could be so base?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Here comes mamma,"
and she dived downstairs.</p>

<p>"Lurline, Lurline," cried her majesty, who had
overheard every word of our conversation. "Lurline,
come here; I wish to speak with you."</p>

<p>Up swam Lurline again, pale with fright. She
entered her mother's room, and the queen turned the
key. I heard the mother's voice within speaking
angrily, and half-an-hour afterwards Lurline left the
chamber, sobbing.</p>

<p>I came forward to soothe her, but she motioned me
away, and put her finger to her lip. I dived after her
downstairs, resolved to hear the worst. It seems her
mother had scolded her for flirting; said she was too
young to marry; that I was too old for her; that she
knew nothing of my family; and that she must not fix
her affections upon anyone who was not of royal blood.</p>

<p>"Here, then," thought I, "among this simple
primitive people, there is as much aristocratic pride as
in our more civilised countries."</p>

<p>What was to be done? Relinquish Lurline for a
foolish piece of barbarous pride. I couldn't and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wouldn't. There was nothing left me but to speak to his
majesty; assume as much dignity as I could and boast
of my pedigree.</p>

<p>At breakfast I thought both the king and queen
cold towards me, but I appeared not to notice it, and
talked away fluently about my country, my family, and
insinuated, rather than said outright, that I was of royal
blood.</p>

<p>Their manner towards me grew by degrees less
frigid, and after breakfast I followed his majesty to his
dais chamber, and proposed for his daughter's hand.
He demurred for a long time, but I declared that in my
own country I, too, had been a king; that I had been
driven from my throne by my rebellious subjects; that,
growing disgusted with ruling, I had sought refuge
from <i>ennui</i> in a life of adventure.</p>

<p>His majesty, like his people, being of a simple
nature, believed all I said, and left me, saying he would
think about it and talk to the queen. I saw him from
the window shortly afterwards in earnest conversation
with her majesty in the garden. I burned to know
the result of their interview.</p>

<p>In the course of the day one of the queen's
mermaids-of-honour informed me that her majesty
desired to speak with me. I entered into her presence
trembling.</p>

<p>She accosted me thus, "Captain Toughyarn, his
majesty has already acquainted me with your proposal,
but before we give our consent to a marriage with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
daughter, even after your assertion that you are of
royal blood, we must know you a little longer.
Marriages are not to be contracted in a hurry. You
did very wrong to engage our daughter's affections
without first consulting us in the matter. It was an
insult to our royal self. However, let that pass; it is
too late now. My daughter seems thoroughly to have
set her affections upon you. I have lectured her
severely for her imprudence; but the matter seems to
have gone so far, that I fear to break her heart if I
peremptorily refuse to give my consent to this marriage.
If my daughter will take my advice, she will, upon
reflection, break off this match. You'll excuse me,
Captain Toughyarn, for saying that I think your age a
decided objection."</p>

<p>"As regards my age, your majesty," I said, "the
men of my country get grey and bald at thirty, though
they maintain their healthful vigour to a prolonged
period. I myself am thirty-six." (I would not say that
I was sixty-three.)</p>

<p>Her majesty looked incredulous, and then a
momentary smile crossed her features, as if she were
having a joke all to herself, but she stifled it
immediately.</p>

<p>"There is another thing, Captain Toughyarn," said
her majesty, "that perhaps you may not be aware of.
Marriages between your race and ours are extremely
rare. When they occur some sacrifice is always expected
on the part of the gentleman, just by way of proving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his love," and she glanced at my legs as she spoke. I
did not quite understand her meaning.</p>

<p>"Sacrifice&mdash;sacrifice," I said to myself. "Ah!
yes," said I, aloud; "your majesty does not wish that
your daughter should leave her house and visit my
country. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"That is part of the conditions, but not all," said
her majesty.</p>

<p>"And what else might your majesty be pleased
to exact from me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, with a smile and a second glance
at my legs, "we should like you&mdash;we expect you
to&mdash;to&mdash;to become in fact, like one of us&mdash;to conform&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite so," I said, without as yet catching her
meaning thoroughly; "to conform&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;to
all the customs of the country I have adopted."</p>

<p>"To <i>all</i> of them, mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you consent to this trifling sacrifice. You
have no objection to&mdash;to be operated upon?"</p>

<p>"Operated upon!" I cried in astonishment. "What?&mdash;How?&mdash;I don't
quite catch your majesty's meaning."</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Toughyarn," said her majesty, "if
I <i>must</i> be more explicit, the fact is, that legs are out of
fashion here, only tails are worn in this country. If
you really wish to marry our daughter, you must submit
to an operation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"W-h-e-w!" whistled I, the real nature of the
sacrifice dawning upon me for the first time. "So that
is your meaning!"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Do you refuse?"</p>

<p>Now, I always prided myself particularly on my
legs. In my youth they were the admiration of the
sex; even now they are far from contemptible, and to
give them in exchange for a tail was of all things the
furthest from my thoughts. I did not know what to
answer.</p>

<p>At length I asked, "And this operation&mdash;how is
it performed, your majesty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is simple enough," was the reply. "A
surgeon is called, who amputates the lower extremities;
a dolphin or other large fish is procured, which, after
being killed, is cut in half, and the tail half of the fish
is bound to that part of your body still suffering from
the operation, until the parts unite, and the transformation
is complete."</p>

<p>"I am infinitely obliged to your majesty," said I,
"but I hope you will pardon me if I refuse to comply
with this last condition. Legs such as mine are
extremely prized in my country; in fact, they are only
to be found in those of the blood royal, and I really
could not consent to part with such a very strong
mark; indeed, perhaps, the only mark of royalty about
my person."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said I, bowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case," said the queen, "I must talk to
his majesty, to see what can be done."</p>

<p>The queen rose. I bowed, and left the apartment.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I heard the king's voice in great
wrath, calling out, "What! he won't sacrifice his legs?
Did you say he <i>won't</i>? <i>Won't</i>, indeed! I'll let him
know who the mer-king is. He comes here uninvited,
wheedles himself into our daughter's affections, and
then his love is found wanting at the proof. He won't
even give up his hideous legs, and wear a respectable
tail for <i>her</i> sake. By my trident, he shall for <i>mine</i>.
I'll tail him. Here, Thomas!" That was the name
of the shark that opened the door for us. "What
ho! Thomas, bite off that insolent stranger's legs
this instant. Come, make haste, and lose no time
about it."</p>

<p>I happened to be looking out of my bedroom
window at the time, which was open. At these words
I plunged through the casement and struck out upwards.
I had not proceeded very far&mdash;though in all
my life I never struck out as I did then&mdash;when I heard
the palace door open and the splash of the huge
monster behind me. I struck out upwards, upwards,
ever upwards, but the immense fish was at my heels
with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p>Truly, I thought my last moment was at hand.
With the energy that despair alone gives, I struck out
so frantically, that even the shark had hard work to
keep up with me, but I was fast getting exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>What should I do when completely so? There
seemed no hope for me.</p>

<p>"While strength lasts, I'll use it," said I, to myself,
and struck out more desperately than ever, but the
shark gained upon me, nevertheless.</p>

<p>At length, after repeated exertions, my head appeared
once more above water. Once more I felt the fresh
breeze on my bald pate.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" I cried.</p>

<p>There was a vessel in sight, not far off. I hailed
her, bawling out with all my might and main, still
swimming furiously. The shark was now nearer than
ever. He had already turned on his back, preparatory
to biting off my legs, and the ship though she had
noticed my distress, and was coming fast to my rescue,
was not sufficiently near as yet to save me.</p>

<p>I felt the tip of the monster's nose against my
shoe. I lunged out a tremendous kick, which ought
to have sent several of its teeth down its throat; at any
rate, it sent him backward about a foot. Meanwhile,
I struck out more fiercely than ever, but the brute
recovered itself and was at me again.</p>

<p>My strength was now quite exhausted. How I
managed to hold out so long puzzles me now. I was
about to sink from sheer exhaustion. In another
moment my legs must have been off, had not one of
the officers of the ship thrown out a rope, which I
clutched eagerly, and being speedily hauled on deck,
the monster was baulked of its prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst yet dangling in air, before my feet had time
to touch the deck, I heard a "bang," and, looking
behind me, to my intense relief, I saw the corpse of my
dread foe bobbing up and down in the waves, and
staining the water with his blood.</p>

<p>"So much for Thomas," thought I.</p>

<p>The sailors were just about to lug it on board, when
at this juncture I awoke.</p>

<p>Lucky for me that my flight was so precipitate. If
<i>she</i> had crossed my path at the last moment I thoroughly
believe the very sight of her sweet face would have
made me consent to the operation. Poor Lurline! But
what is the use of giving way to sensibility, gentlemen?
And, as to losing one's legs, it is bad enough to lose
them in an engagement for the honour and glory of
one's country, but to have them bitten off by a shark,
or amputated by a mer-surgeon, at the caprice of a mer-king,
and a fish's tail substituted in lieu thereof, is a
thing that Toughyarn can't quite stomach.</p>

<p>Supposing me to have been weak enough to have
submitted to the operation at the tears and entreaties
of Lurline, it becomes a very different matter when my
limbs are exacted as a forfeiture, and imperiously
demanded by an infuriated parent.</p>

<p>Toughyarn may be as weak as a child in the hands
of a pretty woman, but he won't be <i>forced</i> to anything
by the greatest tyrant that ever existed.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bravo, Toughyarn!" cried all the company, with
one voice.</p>

<p>This enthusiasm was as much in praise of the sentiment
that the captain had wound up with as for the
story itself.</p>

<p>"I knew the captain wouldn't be beaten in a yarn
by the best of us," said Hardcase, "although he did
find mine rather difficult to swallow."</p>

<p>Cheers and rattling of glasses followed, and the
captain's health was drunk with due honours, after
which the chairman rose and addressed the company
thus:</p>

<p>"Most honourable and august members and guests
of the Wonder Club, you will all allow that the gallant
captain has amply expiated his offence. There is, however,
an individual present who has been guilty of the
same offence as the captain, and who has not yet undergone
the penance expected from him by our club."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned towards the little comedian
who blushed and laughed.</p>

<p>"Need I point out that individual, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Cries of "No, no!"</p>

<p>"Now, Jollytoast, for your turn, old boy," said the
tragedian.</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried other members.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," continued Mr. Oldstone, "our time
is short; the clock has already struck two, and I have
observed more than one yawn from amongst the company.
It will be my painful duty to dismiss this genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
meeting, but I cannot conscientiously do so without
first performing an act of justice to the company. I,
therefore, sentence Mr. Jollytoast to a comic song
before our meeting breaks up." (Cheers and laughter.
Cries of "Hear, hear," and "Now then Jollytoast;
a song, a song&mdash;Jollytoast for a song!")</p>

<p>The little gentleman, thus addressed, begged for a
moment's reflection, and then broke into a very merry
ditty with a chorus, in which all had to join. There
was plenty of acting and grimace in it, with here and
there a part spoken, and any amount of "tooral-looral"
in the chorus.</p>

<p>The song being ended, our comic friend was
much applauded, and the chairman, in a short speech,
expressed himself satisfied with the expiation, and,
wishing all the company a "good night," and many more
such genial meetings, was about to retire, when Captain
Toughyarn called out, "Avast! there, chairman. You
are never going to dismiss the crew without splicing the
main brace first!"</p>

<p>"True, true, captain," said the president; "besides
the health of our sublime warbler, Mr. Jollytoast, has
not been drunk yet. Fill your glasses, gentlemen, and
drink to the health of Mr. Jollytoast."</p>

<p>Shouts and yells ensued, during which our comic
guest's health was drunk with three times three, to
which he responded in a short and laughable speech
that called forth more cheering.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," said the chairman, "after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
having spent the tenth anniversary of our club in the
company of mermaids, sea monsters, ghouls, spirits, and
phantom fleas, how can we do better than wind up this
honourable meeting by joining hands and singing that
song composed by one of our members&mdash;now, alas! no
more&mdash;to be sung at the inauguration of the Wonder
Club?"</p>

<p>The proposal was received with applause, and all
the company joining hands, our host included, sung the
following ditty:&mdash;</p>

<h4>Song of the Wonder Club.</h4>

<p>The song at an end, a last bumper was drunk by
way of a nightcap, and each gallant member or guest
walked, or staggered, as the case might be, off to bed.</p>

<p>"Ho, steward!" cried the captain, to the landlord;
"douse the glims, and show the passengers to their
cabins. Where have you slung my hammock?"</p>

<p>Our host provided candles for each of his guests,
and bidding them all "good-night," gave a yawn,
and followed the example of the rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>The Headless Lady.&mdash;The Artist's First Story.</h3>

<p>The morning following the saturnalia was cold and
bleak. Without it was snowing hard, and the windows
of the old inn were covered with frost crystals. Breakfast
was late, few of the members of the club having
yet risen, apparently not yet recovered from the effects
of the previous evening.</p>

<p>The landlord exerted himself to make the interior
of his inn as cheerful as the gloomy state of the
weather would permit. A large log crackled on the
hearth, and the breakfast table teemed with all the
delicacies that the inn could boast of; coffee, toast,
hot rolls, eggs and bacon, ham, chicken, tongue, and
fresh butter. One by one the guests made their
appearance. They seemed to have slept well, for they
looked none the worse for their last night's carousal.</p>

<p>The last to enter the breakfast room was our fresh
arrival, Mr. Vandyke McGuilp. He presented a very
different appearance to any of the rest. He was pale
and haggard, and his hair hung disordered over his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you have not slept well, Mr. McGuilp,"
said Mr. Oldstone. "What is the matter? It surely
can't be the punch, for you drank less than any of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
last night. Why, I don't believe you drank more than
a couple of glasses the whole time; but perhaps you
are not accustomed to these orgies, and a little upsets
you. Look at us&mdash;seasoned old casks all of us&mdash;we
are as jolly as ever. As for myself, I never felt better
in all my life."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not that," replied our artist; "but I feel
somehow I passed an indifferent night."</p>

<p>Dr. Bleedem felt the pulse and looked at the tongue
of the new guest, and pronounced him a little feverish,
but said that it would soon pass over.</p>

<p>"My blessed eyes!" cried the captain, "if the
gentleman doesn't look as scared as I felt when the
shark was at my heels last night. What say you mine
host?"</p>

<p>"Well, Captain," said the landlord, "if I might
venture a remark, the gentleman looks as if he had
had a visit from the <i>headless lady</i>."</p>

<p>McGuilp started.</p>

<p>"Why do you start, sir?" inquired Mr. Blackdeed,
who alone had noticed the action, his eye being ever
open to anything of a dramatic effect.</p>

<p>"A little nervousness, that is all," replied the artist.
"I feel far from well this morning."</p>

<p>"I assure you, your action was quite dramatic,"
said the tragedian. "Oblige me by repeating it.
Thank you; I'll practise it before the glass this
morning. It will just do for my tragedy, when the
wicked baron, who is in the act of carrying off a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
by force, is suddenly checked in his career by the
appearance of the spirit of her brother, whom he has
murdered."</p>

<p>"Ha! What's that all about?" cried Oldstone,
who had pricked up his ears at something resembling
a story, while the rest were gossiping on indifferent
matters. "You must act us a scene out of that
tragedy, Blackdeed; remember, we had no story from
you last night."</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready, gentlemen," said the landlord.</p>

<p>The guests flocked round the table and commenced
their repast.</p>

<p>"By the by, landlord," said McGuilp, as that
worthy was about to quit the room, "you give your inn
a curious name. Is there any origin to it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the landlord, "it was my
grandfather, or great grandfather, who gave it that
name&mdash;I'm not sure which."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, is there no origin to it?&mdash;no legend
connected with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, your honour," said the landlord,
"folks used to say that this house was haunted by a
lady without a head; but that's a long time ago. I
don't exactly recollect the particulars of the story, but
I have heard my father say, when I was a youngster,
that he had seen her; but it's five and thirty years come
Michaelmas that this inn has been in my hands, and
I never see anything of the sort, sir. No, sir; depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
upon it, she don't 'walk' now, sir. Even in my
father's time her visits used to be rare, though my
grandfather used to tell me lots of stories about her
when I was a child."</p>

<p>"Do you remember any of those stories?"</p>

<p>"Not now, sir. I only remember hearing say that
the lady was a nun; but for what offence she was
beheaded I can't exactly call to mind now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might be able to refresh your memory,"
said the artist. "What would you say if I really had
had a visit from the headless lady last night?"</p>

<p>"You, sir!" exclaimed the landlord in great
astonishment. "You don't mean to say that you really
<i>did see</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The headless lady. Yes, I do; I mean to say
that I had a visit from her last night."</p>

<p>The landlord opened his eyes and mouth with a
look of awe. The guests remained as if petrified. The
captain's red face grew a shade less so. Mr. Parnassus
became livid. The tragedian's hair stood on end.
Mr. Oldstone looked a few years older, while the
countenances of the whole company betrayed various
grades of wonder and consternation.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" coughed the chairman of the previous
evening, at length breaking silence. "Perhaps you
would not mind telling us about your experiences of last
night, Mr. McGuilp? I am sure we are all most
curious to hear something about this mysterious lady.
I have never met anyone yet who could say that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
had seen her, though I have heard over and over again
that she used to 'walk.'"</p>

<p>Thus entreated, our artist proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>Well, then, after I left you, gentlemen, last night,
before I retired to rest, in looking round my apartment,
I was much struck with an old portrait, painted in a
very early style, of a lady in a nun's dress. In spite
of the hard style of the period, there was something
in the face&mdash;a sort of resigned melancholy&mdash;that
interested me exceedingly. Still it was little more
than a passing glance that I bestowed on the picture,
for I felt very sleepy, and more inclined for bed than
for criticising works of art. I accordingly undressed
as quickly as I could, blew out the light, and in two
minutes was fast asleep.</p>

<p>I could not have enjoyed more than a quarter-of-an-hour's
repose, when I was suddenly awakened by what
felt like a cold hand pressed upon my forehead. I
started up, and tried to call out, but could not raise my
voice above a whisper. I looked in the direction in
which I expected to find the person who had awakened
me, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>All was pitch dark around me, but I heard, or
thought I heard, a deep sigh as I strained my ears to
catch some sound of the intruder.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" I called out, in a husky whisper;
but I received no reply.</p>

<p>Beginning to be alarmed, fancying that some
dishonest person had entered my chamber to rob me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
or else that it was someone of the household given to
walking in their sleep, I sat up in bed and peered into
the darkness.</p>

<p>As I listened I distinctly heard a low moan of such
piteous anguish that it made my flesh creep and my
hair to stand up.</p>

<p>"Who could it be?" I asked myself. "Perhaps
some person of unsound mind in the family whose habit
it was to walk at night, and lurk about the bed-chambers."</p>

<p>The thought was anything but a pleasant one.
Who knows what form this madness might take? Mad
people are not to be trusted. I trembled to think what
the intent of my visitor might be. Was he armed? I
tried to reach out my hand for my tinder-box, but such
a supernatural terror pervaded my whole frame, that my
limbs were paralysed, and I remained sitting up in bed,
as if rooted to the spot, without power to move a
finger.</p>

<p>At length, not being able to bear this suspense any
longer, I bethought me of striking terror into my
visitant, and though carrying no arms about me, my
object was to alarm the stranger into speaking, so I
called out in husky tones as loud as my voice would
permit me, "Speak, or I fire!"</p>

<p>But no answer was given. What was to be done?
I could not carry my threat into execution, having no
weapon. I could not even move from my post for fear,
I felt the cold perspiration streaming down from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
temples, my whole frame shook, and my teeth chattered
together.</p>

<p>It was something more than mortal fear that I
suffered; it was as if I were in the presence of some
supernatural being. Gradually I became aware of a
dark form, apparently that of a woman, close to my
bed. My eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness,
and I could distinguish the various objects in my
bed-chamber with greater facility.</p>

<p>I rivetted my eyes on the figure, but all I could
discern was a long black robe and two white hands. I
looked for the face, but in vain. It seemed covered up,
for the shoulders merged into the darkness.</p>

<p>Soon, as if to aid my vision, a sort of pale blue light
spread a halo around the figure, and grew gradually
brighter, setting it off in relief. I could now see the
whole figure distinctly. I looked for the head. Oh,
horror! <i>It was wanting.</i></p>

<p>I shuddered, and felt an intense desire to scream,
but my voice was gone. Had I then really lived to see
a ghost? Was there, then, some foundation for the
strange name given to the inn? I had never heard
from my friend Rustcoin that it was reported haunted,
and I most assuredly should have heard about it if he
had had any knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a thing not generally known; perhaps
its appearance was not usual, and it only appeared at
intervals to certain privileged beings. Was I one of
those beings? I asked myself. Perhaps so. It might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
have something to communicate. I would address it,
but my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, for now
I saw distinctly that the head I had missed was carried
under the left arm of the figure.</p>

<p>I marked well the face; it was extremely beautiful,
and I thought I recognised a likeness to the old portrait
I had been looking at; but oh! how far short that old
piece of painted panel fell of the original; if, indeed, it
was ever intended for a representation of the lineaments
I now gazed upon.</p>

<p>I made a second effort to address it, but as I
opened my mouth to speak I heard another most
audible moan from the headless figure. I was awed,
but that intense fear which I experienced when I became
aware that some stranger had entered my chamber
had all but vanished now that I was <i>certain</i> that I was
in the presence of a denizen of the spirit world.</p>

<p>Awful as this certainty was, it seemed to fade into
insignificance when compared with the terrible feeling
of doubt I had before experienced. I now felt comparatively
relieved; so much so, indeed, that I even
found room in my heart for pity&mdash;that one so young
and so beautiful as she appeared to be should have
suffered such a cruel and ignominious death. At
length, in a low and subdued tone, I addressed the
figure.</p>

<p>"Spirit, whate'er thou art or wert, whether of good
or evil, whether from the regions of the blest or the
haunts of the damned, speak! Declare thy mission."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>A hollow moan proceeded from the trunk of the
headless figure, and the eyes in the head held under
its arm rolled upwards with a look of despair, while
in tones low, solemn, yet sweet, it spoke, the lips
vibrating, though the voice came from the neck.</p>

<p>"I am the spirit of one who, dying in mortal sin,
am doomed to perpetual unrest. Beheaded for my
crimes in this world, I wander nightly round this spot,
the scene of my infamy. Here where this house now
stands once stood the convent whose walls imprisoned
me while yet on earth. Forced into a life of seclusion
for which I had no calling by a relentless parent who,
deeming that his daughter's alliance with the man she
loved would sully his illustrious name, I was compelled to
utter vows with my lips against which my heart revolted.</p>

<p>"I could not join in the pious oraisons of my sister
nuns, for while my knees bent and my lips moved my
spirit was elsewhere. Day after day I languished
within my prison walls, mechanically going through my
duties with the rest, but to all outward seeming with
devotion, for not one of them knew but that I myself
had chosen that calling.</p>

<p>"None knew then what I bore within. I made no
friends, sought no confidant. When I confessed, my
confessions were always of a vague sort, for I was
reserved on that one point which, if confessed, would
have been regarded as the most heinous crime.</p>

<p>"At length our father confessor, who was an old
man, died, and a new priest took his place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Holy Virgin! it was my lover. He had discovered
my whereabouts, and, with no holier object than the
desire to see me again, he had entered into holy
orders, and by stratagem contrived to enter our
convent."</p>

<p>Here the figure gave a deep sigh, and paused. The
face writhed, as if struggling with itself, whether it
should proceed or remain silent. The pause was
agonising, but I wished to hear more.</p>

<p>"Proceed," I said.</p>

<p>Another deep sigh ensued, and she continued.</p>

<p>"Mortal," she said with evident reluctance, "you
will despise me when you have heard the full extent of
my crime. No matter, I am not what I was&mdash;I can
bear it. Know, then, that I fell. Ay, blush for me,
hate, loathe, despise me as thou wilt. Those holy walls
which re-echoed for ages with nought save the prayers
and the chanting of pious nuns, were doomed to hear
the whispered words of fierce passion and to witness
scenes that must for ever leave a stain upon their fair
memory.</p>

<p>"Enough, our intrigue was discovered, and I was
sentenced to death. I was beheaded secretly, yet even
blood could not wash out the foul stain from my soul,
and I have ever since been doomed to eternal pangs of
remorse."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed, "and had your lover no
knowledge of this?"</p>

<p>"He had, and furious at the news, he came by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
night and set fire to the convent. The building was
razed to the ground, and every nun perished."</p>

<p>"And your lover," I asked, "what became of him?"</p>

<p>"He died shortly afterwards. I was permitted to
see his spirit but once, and then he was torn away from
me for ever. It is that which grieves me most, for I
know not what fate is reserved for him.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that his state may be happier than
mine. Oh, how willingly would I bear the weight of all
his sins, so that his portion might be in the region of
the blest. I would then bear my doom without a
murmur, even were my sufferings ten-fold."</p>

<p>"And with this charitable feeling towards the author
of thy ruin, canst thou possess a soul so black as to
merit eternal punishment?" said I.</p>

<p>"Alas!" murmured the spirit, "when we die in
mortal sin our doom is sealed, yet I would fain hope
still that before I quit this state of purgatory and am
consigned to eternal flames that the prayers of
others&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand; it was with that object, then, thou
soughtest me&mdash;that I might pray for thy soul?"</p>

<p>"It was," replied the spirit; "and also for my
lover. Oh, let me not pray in vain. Tell me thou
wilt pray for me."</p>

<p>"Spirit," I answered, "I am not of thy creed. I am
a Protestant. Our church holds all prayers for the
dead useless."</p>

<p>"I know it; but it is an error. Pray, nevertheless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Thou comest from Rome, and wilt shortly return
thither. Bid the pious monks and nuns there pray for
my soul, and for the soul of my lover."</p>

<p>"Spirit, thy request is granted, and if my own weak
prayers may serve in any way to relieve thy torments,
they, too, shall be added."</p>

<p>A smile of the most ineffable sweetness and gratitude,
more eloquent than words, spread over the face of the
decapitated. She pressed my hand fervently with her
pale, icy-cold fingers, and gradually faded from my gaze.</p>

<p>When she had vanished, it was already daybreak.
Sleep had deserted my eyelids, and as I tossed restlessly
in my bed I kept wondering to myself whether what I
had seen and heard could be a dream, or whether I
really and truly had held converse with a ghost.</p>

<p>The rest of the time, with the exception of a short
doze I took previous to rising this morning, I spent in
prayer for the release of the soul of the headless lady
from purgatory, and likewise that of her lover.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I leave the reader to imagine the sensation our
artist's spiritual visitation excited at the breakfast-table
before the members of the Wonder Club, whose thirst for
the marvellous and supernatural was insatiable. Second
and third-hand ghost stories are common enough,
and are generally taken for what they are worth; but
here was the case of a ghost story told by the ghost seer
himself, who had seen and spoken to the ghost only the
night before; in the very house, too, in which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
all been sleeping. Then, added to that, was the manner
of the narrator, which alone bore the stamp of truth on
it. The quick roll of his eye, when he was describing
the excited state of his feelings at the time, the
involuntary shudder, and the furtive glance which he
from time to time would give over his shoulder; all
signs of a nervous system that has received some
great shock&mdash;to say nothing of his worn and disordered
appearance, as might be expected in a man that has
seen a ghost.</p>

<p>All this enhanced the power of his words immensely.
Then there was the strange fact to be borne in mind
that no one had informed him that the house was
haunted. No one could say that his imagination had
been unduly excited by any story concerning the house
previous to his going to sleep. He had retired to rest
calmly, without any fear of a spiritual visitation. And
how could it all be a dream? For the landlord now
distinctly remembered that all our artist had related
was exactly what had been told him by his grandfather.</p>

<p>Various were the exclamations of wonderment from
the guests at the breakfast-table. They gazed with awe
on the narrator, then at each other, then at the narrator
again. Our artist had won the esteem of the whole
club.</p>

<p>Breakfast being finished, our friends drew round the
fire, and the landlord left the room, looking grave and
shaking his head. McGuilp's strange adventure had
furnished food for comment for two or three hours afterwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
The whole forenoon nothing was talked of but
the ghost.</p>

<p>At length a lull occurred in the conversation, and
someone recollected that it was Professor Cyanite's
turn to tell a story. At that moment our host's pretty
daughter, Helen, a blooming girl of sixteen, entered
with the lunch.</p>

<p>Our artist was enraptured with the golden hair, blue
eyes, and rosy cheeks of the maiden, after the swarthy
beauties of Italy; but, above all, with her innocent,
modest, and half-bashful manner.</p>

<p>"Well, Helen," said Mr. Oldstone, "has your father
told you about the ghost?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," replied the girl, her merry expression
changing suddenly to a look of awe; "he did frighten
me so; I am sure I shall never be able to sleep again in
this house."</p>

<p>"This is the gentleman who saw the ghost, Helen,"
cried one of the other members, pointing to our artist.</p>

<p>The maiden turned and saw a fresh face in the club.
Our artist was the youngest, by many years, of any
of the other gentlemen present, besides which he was
decidedly good looking. He gazed into the eyes of the
girl till the poor child blushed crimson and looked
down abashed.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! Helen, my girl," said Mr. Crucible, one
of the oldest members of the club, "you don't blush like
that when you look at us old fogies&mdash;what is the
matter, eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>A general laugh ensued, much to the confusion of
poor Helen, and our artist himself felt not a little
confused at having produced such an impression on
the girl in the presence of so many others of his own
sex.</p>

<p>"What ho! Helen, bring another log; we're
freezing," cried Professor Cyanite, changing the conversation,
much to the relief of the girl, who was glad to
escape from the banter of the club by quitting the
room.</p>

<p>Our guests began their repast of cold meat and
pickles, bread and cheese, and home-brewed ale. After
they had finished the daughter of the landlord re-entered
with a large log, which she placed on the fire.</p>

<p>"That's right, my girl," said Mr. Oldstone, drawing
his chair up to the fire; "now bring us pipes."</p>

<p>The girl left the room, and soon returned with a
bundle of long clay pipes, already waxed, which she
distributed amongst the company, receiving a chuck
under the chin from one; a gentle pat on the cheek
from another; from a third, a stroke on the head; from
a fourth, a squeeze of the hand; a fifth placed his arm
round her waist; while a sixth pretended to kiss her,
but no further harm was done. Our artist placed a
chair for her next to himself, round the fire, and asked
her if she were fond of hearing stories.</p>

<p>The maiden blushed and smiled and said that
she was.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Helen," said Mr. Oldstone; "remain with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
us and hear a fresh story. Professor Cyanite is just
going to favour us."</p>

<p>A circle was formed round the fire; Helen seating
herself modestly by the side of the artist, while the
professor, sitting back in his chair, and stretching out
his legs towards the fire, stroked his ample forehead,
and with a puff at his pipe, commenced the following
story.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>The Demon Guide; or, the Gnome of the
Mountain.&mdash;The Geologist's Story.</h3>

<p>Some twenty years ago, when I was on a scientific
tour in the mountains of Switzerland with a friend of
mine, who travelled with the same object as myself, a
strange incident occurred to me, which I have never
been able satisfactorily to explain. We journeyed in
each other's company daily, each carrying with him a
geologist's hammer and a light travelling bag slung
round one shoulder, for the purpose of collecting
specimens of various minerals, fossils, etc., that we
might find during our march.</p>

<p>We jogged along merrily enough together, each day
bringing home some rare specimen or other. We were
both in full vigour of health, and both capital climbers.
Mountain air and exercise had given us marvellous
appetites, and I never remember being in better spirits
in my life. As we were not pushed for time or money,
and were on a scientific expedition instead of what is
called a pleasure trip, it was less our object to scour
large tracts of country than to stroll leisurely through
the district, making observations by the way.</p>

<p>Travelling, therefore, both with the same object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and not obliged to hurry onward, we had nothing to try
our tempers, as ordinary tourists have, who travel in
company and usually fall out with each other by the
way because one with short wind can't keep up with
his longer-winded companion.</p>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, is more trying to the temper than
being obliged to keep pace with a well-trained
mountaineer if you yourself happen to be out of
training. To see him striding on ahead with the most
perfect ease and enjoyment, whilst you are toiling and
sweating, and puffing and gasping in the rear, parched
with thirst and ready to drop with fatigue; perhaps knee
deep in snow, plunging about like a porpoise, in the
frantic attempt to keep up with your well-trained
companion.</p>

<p>Why, the treadmill is a joke to it! How you curse
your folly for coming to visit such barbarous places, and
how you internally vow never to leave home again.
How inconsiderate of your companion to leave you so
far behind, as if you did not belong to his party. He
seems to ignore you, and you feel the slight. He ought
to keep pace with you, not you with him, you
think.</p>

<p>How you hate him for his rude health and long
wind; and should he so far forget himself as to add insult
to injury by bawling after you to "come on," and not
"lag behind;" or call you by some such name as "slow
coach," "stick-in-the-mud," or other choice epithet, oh,
then it is not to be borne. Your ire is raised beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
due bounds. You could stab him if you only had him
near enough, and a weapon handy.</p>

<p>If any of my friends who content themselves with
taking their daily walk of a mile or so on level ground
fancy that this is an exaggeration of the state of a man's
feelings when the body is tired out and the nerves on
the stretch, I recommend him to try a trip in some
mountainous district when out of training, and to choose
as companion some well-trained son of the mountains.</p>

<p>As I observed before, gentlemen, my friend and I
were not wont to fall out in this way with one another,
and we took our journey very easily, chipping out a
fossil here and a crystal there, conversing the while on
secondary and tertiary formations, volcanic eruptions,
alluvial deposits, debris, quartz, and marl, mica, slate,
talc, calc, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Thus we journeyed on together day after day for
weeks, until we found that the face of the country
changed suddenly. Two mountain ranges branched off
almost at right angles from one another.</p>

<p>My friend and I resolved to separate, and each to
explore in a different direction, and to meet again in
about a fortnight.</p>

<p>We accordingly parted, and I commenced exploring
a wild track of mountainous country alone. Charmed
with the wild beauty of the scene, as well as interested
in its geological structure, I suffered my footsteps to
lead me onward until hunger stole upon me. I had
eaten nothing since the morning, and it was now getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
late. One day at home without food is bad enough,
but it is not to be compared with a day spent in the
mountains, walking and climbing all the time.</p>

<p>I looked out for a ch&acirc;let, but there was none visible.
Meanwhile it grew dark, and I found myself benighted.
There was not even a shed to rest under, so I was
obliged to repose my weary limbs upon the cold, damp,
rock, with such shelter from the night air as the dark
pine trees afforded.</p>

<p>It was a strange, wild, scene the spot where I
encamped. The spectre-like pines stretched forth their
weird branches, drooping with bearded moss, like phantom
Druids invoking a curse over this scene of desolation.
The moon, peeping fitfully through the black
clouds, lit up the glaciers on the mountain opposite.
Here and there was a great pine torn up by the roots,
or over-hanging the abyss below. Immense clumps of
rock, grown over with dank moss, were interspersed
through the dark pine forest. A small stream trickled
over the large stones, pursuing its zig-zag course till it
reached the valley below.</p>

<p>The howling of the wind and the occasional thunder
of the avalanche from some neighbouring mountain
lent a kind of terror to the scene, which I should
have enjoyed, had I been in a more comfortable frame
of mind. But, with the gnawing pains of hunger and
the horrible feeling of doubt as to whether I should
ever meet with any traces of civilisation where I
might recruit my wasted energies, the beauty of the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was shut from me, and I found it only a cold, damp,
disagreeable retreat.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the night when I took up my
quarters here, but it was dark and cloudy, and I put up
at this place, despairing of finding a more hospitable
lodging, on account of the darkness, besides which I
was tired out. I had reposed in my uncomfortable
quarters for, it might be, two or three hours, though
without sleeping, when the clouds began to disperse and
the sky was calm and serene, the moon bright and clear,
so I thought I would leave my camping place and venture
a little further, in the vague hope of finding some
hospitable ch&acirc;let where I might obtain fire and food.</p>

<p>I was now considerably rested from my fatigue, but
the pangs of hunger grew ever more intense. I wandered
on and on, till the pines grew less thick, and a wide
extended view opened before me, when I fancied that I
descried afar off in the valley a light. My heart began
to revive. As I strode onward I saw below me a small
lake, over which frowned dark toppling crags. The
moon shone brightly over all.</p>

<p>Still keeping the distant ch&acirc;let in sight, I could
think of little else than the meal which would await me
on my arrival; but while glancing casually over the
lake illumined by the moonbeams, and the cliff that
overhung it, my eye was suddenly arrested by an object,
apparently a human being, clambering up a height that
I should have imagined inaccessible to any mortal man.
It literally overhung the lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>At first I thought my eyes deceived me, but as I
looked I was more and more convinced that it was a
human being performing this feat. I had heard much
of the daring of the Swiss mountaineers, but this beat
anything I ever heard of, for the cliff, besides over-hanging,
was comparatively smooth, being of slate, and
there appeared nothing to hold on by.</p>

<p>"Could it really be a human being?" I asked
myself. If so, it was so hideously misshapen as hardly
to deserve the title. In spite of my hunger, I panted
awhile in breathless anxiety to observe the course of this
creature.</p>

<p>"Surely some madman," thought I, "tired of his
life."</p>

<p>Every moment I expected to see his foot slip and to
hear a splash in the lake below; but no, the being,
whatever it was, crawled steadily upwards like a huge
spider, till it gained the summit of the cliff. I then lost
sight of it. A few steps further on led me to the spot
the climber had reached, when soon among the
lengthened shadows of the pines, I descried a shadow
which was not that of a tree.</p>

<p>I approached, and as the moon lit up the object in
my path, I beheld a sight that made my blood freeze to
look upon. It was one of those hideous cr&ecirc;tins which
inhabit the valleys of all mountainous countries.</p>

<p>I started, and the idiot, who gazed at me vacantly at
first, seemed to have sense enough to be aware of the
impression he had made, and to take a fiendish delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the effect that he had produced. The aspect of this
being was the most frightful of anything I had ever
seen in human shape. He could not have exceeded
four feet in height, but the breadth of his shoulders was
such as to make his figure a complete square. His
neck was short, and his head, which was enormous, was
covered over with scant sandy hair. The complexion
was ghastly; the lips thin and livid, the nose flat and
spreading, and the eyes, which were an immense
distance apart, pale green and fishy; the face was round
and broad, and though generally idiotic in expression,
was lit up at times with a look of intelligence, mixed
with the most preternatural cunning and malignity.
The muscular development of the upper part of this
strange figure was prodigious, and the arms were so
long that the fingers all but touched the ground, but
the legs were extremely short and misshapen, the feet
being monstrous. His back was round as a camel's,
and from his throat down to his waist hung a huge
go&icirc;tre, which gave a still more disgusting look to his
<i>tout ensemble</i>; added to this, his ears were large and
shaggy, his fingers short and stunted, the palms of his
hands hard and horny. He was dressed after the usual
fashion of the Swiss peasantry in that part of Switzerland,
but his clothes were so patched and tattered, that the
masterpiece was barely discernible.</p>

<p>I gazed for some moments in silent horror at the
spectacle before me, when the monster blocking up my
path clapped his hands suddenly on his thighs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
burst into a loud discordant laugh, exhibiting two rows
of black, uneven teeth. My blood curdled as the echo
of those fiendish tones broke on my ear. I recoiled,
but, mastering my fear, I said in his own native
tongue&mdash;or, rather, in better German than is spoken
among the peasantry&mdash;"Well, my friend, does my
appearance amuse you? Are strangers so rare in
your country that they are found worthy of so much
notice?"</p>

<p>The idiot gazed at me awhile with vacant stare,
then pointed to his mouth, to signify that he was dumb.</p>

<p>"Poor wretch," I muttered to myself; "and yet he
seems to understand a little."</p>

<p>I thought I would ask him by signs where he lived.
I read by his eye, which suddenly grew intelligent, much
to my surprise, that he understood my question, and he
answered by gestures, which seemed to say, "My home
is here, there, and everywhere. On the black mountain
top, in the pine forest, by the still lake&mdash;anywhere
where there is earth and sky."</p>

<p>"Poor wanderer," thought I; "houseless, like myself,
and yet how infinitely more contented. Who knows
but that that stunted form may contain the soul
of a philosopher." "Idiot," I said, with all possible
meekness in my outward bearing, "I am hungry. Can
you lead me to a ch&acirc;let where I may get food and
shelter?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said I. "Lead on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The dwarf gave me a peculiar look, which I
understood to mean, "What will you give me if I show
you the way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be afraid," said I; "I'll pay you well;
only make haste; I'm starving."</p>

<p>I put my finger in my waistcoat pocket to make him
comprehend that I was willing to reward him, but he
glanced contemptuously at my gesture, and, thrusting
his hand into his pocket, he brought out a handful of
good-sized gold nuggets, which he threw towards me
with a disdainful air.</p>

<p>I was amazed, and seeing them glitter in the moonlight,
I stopped to pick them up. At this the creature
burst out again into a loud laugh. I felt somewhat
abashed at this reproof of my covetousness from one
who evidently despised filthy lucre himself, but I consoled
my conscience with the thought that I looked
upon the nuggets more from a geologist's point of view
than from a miser's.</p>

<p>"Where did he find the gold?" I asked myself.
"Could it really be a great philosopher who stood
before me, who despised the yellow metal, or was it an
idiot who did not know the value of it?"</p>

<p>These reflections of mine were silent. Nevertheless,
the cripple gave me to understand with a nod of his
head and an unmistakable look in his eye, that he
very well understood what they were worth to such
men as myself; but with another gesture he expressed
that for himself he was above it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed," said I, "then what would you of me, if
not gold?"</p>

<p>He gave me a malicious smile, and nodded his head
slightly, but I understood not the gesture.</p>

<p>I was impatient, and wanted to put an end to our
mummery, so I said, "Come, lead on; I am hungry.
Since you despise gold, I suppose you will do so much
for me as an act of friendship?"</p>

<p>He grinned from ear to ear and nodded.</p>

<p>"It is well," said I, and I followed my guide.</p>

<p>We began slowly to descend the mountain, my guide
running nimbly on in front, then standing still at intervals
and beckoning to me. This he continued to do
until we arrived at the foot of the mountain, and I
remember feeling an irresistible and unaccountable
impulse to follow my guide more quickly than before.</p>

<p>As the steel is attracted to the magnet, so I felt
irresistibly attracted towards the monster. It was as if
he possessed some strange magnetic power over me, for
whenever he lifted up his finger to beckon to me I felt
it impossible to resist following him.</p>

<p>I thought the feeling might be fancy at first, and I
attributed my quickened pace against my own will to the
impetus given by the steep declivity of the mountain,
but afterwards I found that it was exactly the same on
level ground.</p>

<p>We walked on further, till we found ourselves at the
foot of a glacier, where stood the ch&acirc;let which I sought.</p>

<p>I knocked and entered, and was welcomed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
owner of the hut, a middle-aged and portly dame with
a go&icirc;tre that hung over her breast, and some young
children with incipient go&icirc;tres.</p>

<p>I told the hostess that I was a hungry traveller, and
asked her to give me the best that she had in the
house.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for my supper I warmed myself by
the fire and scrutinised the inmates of the cottage.
The children seemed very healthy, and not bad looking,
if they had not been all disfigured with the family
go&icirc;tre, which they all inherited in a greater or less
degree. They seemed to be great friends with my
guide, gambolling around him and buffeting him
unmercifully.</p>

<p>At length my supper arrived, consisting of poached
eggs, cold sausage and ham, Swiss cheese, stale bread,
and some sort of spirit drunk in the mountains. Having
concluded my repast, I lit a pipe, and, drawing up my
chair to the fire, entered into conversation with mine
hostess.</p>

<p>"This is your son, I presume?" asked I of the landlady,
pointing to my guide.</p>

<p>"No, sir," she replied; "he is only a poor cr&ecirc;tin
that I have taken in out of charity, as the children are
fond of him. They say in these parts that it is lucky
to have an idiot in the house, so, having none in my
family, I took in this poor afflicted being; though, as
to being lucky, all the luck which I've known since&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hostess suddenly stopped in her conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and her face became locked and rigid without any
apparent reason.</p>

<p>I looked in the direction of the cripple, and observed
his glance fixed on the hostess. It was a glance which
nearly took my breath away. No wonder the landlady
paused in her conversation. It was as if he possessed
the gift of the evil eye. The magnetic influence he had
over her completely closed her mouth.</p>

<p>Curious to know whether the landlady was really
under a spell, I resumed.</p>

<p>"And this unfortunate, besides being idiotic, is he
also deaf and dumb?"</p>

<p>The landlady seemed to awake suddenly, as from a
dream, and replied, "Alas! yes, sir; no one has ever
heard him utter a sound, or even&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she paused again, and again I noticed the
creature's glance fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," I observed, following up the
conversation, "for I myself this evening have discoursed
with him by signs, and so far from being idiotic, I must
say that I found him very intelligent."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, sir," she rejoined; "and if you should
want a guide to-morrow, you could not do better than
take him. No one knows the mountains here better
than he."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I replied; "then he cannot be altogether
an idiot."</p>

<p>"Well, as to that, sir, I fancy at times he is more
knave than fool. Indeed, I cannot quite make him out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
He is an odd being. No one hereabouts knows who
his parents were, or how he came in these parts."</p>

<p>Again the landlady ceased suddenly, as before, and
I noticed again that the creature's eye was fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"What a very mysterious personage," I resumed,
affecting not to notice the magnetic spell the worthy
dame appeared to be under. "I am interested in this
odd creature. Tell me more of him."</p>

<p>Mine hostess was unable to reply.</p>

<p>"Why do you pause?" I asked. "Why do you not
answer?"</p>

<p>The creature's eye was upon me now, and I
experienced a curious sensation, as if my voice was
suddenly taken away from me, that I had no power to
move a limb; in fact, that I was completely in the
power of this horrible imp; but rousing myself, I
determined to combat against this spell, and I succeeded
in stammering a few words with the utmost difficulty.
But that fearful eye was again upon me, and my tongue
was completely tied; my limbs grew stiff and paralysed,
and so I remained for some minutes, till the eye was
removed.</p>

<p>"What can this strange feeling be which has just
come over me?" I asked. "I never felt so in all my
life before."</p>

<p>The cr&ecirc;tin's eye vacillated between me and the
dame, as if to forbid further conversation. Feeling
tired, and not caring for further discourse, as well
as glad of an excuse to escape from my friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
whose mysterious power over myself I had already
experienced and therefore could not deny, I thought I
would take rest until the morning, so I asked for a
candle, and was shown into a small chamber with a
heap of straw in one corner of it. I partly undressed,
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Thus I reposed till an early hour in the morning,
though still dark, when I was suddenly awakened by a
terrific snore. I started up, and remained in a sitting
position. A pause, then again there was a long, deep-drawn,
unmistakable repetition of the same. I fixed
my eyes on the spot whence the sound proceeded, and
perceived, as well as the darkness would permit, a heap
upon the floor in the opposite corner of the apartment.</p>

<p>Who could it be? I was about to strike a light to
satisfy my curiosity, though I had but little doubt it
was my friend of the previous evening, when the sleeper,
to my surprise, began talking in his sleep; and my
ill-favoured friend, it seemed, was dumb.</p>

<p>My hand was arrested in the act of striking a light,
as the speaker began talking loud and fast and in a very
peculiar strain. I was curious to hear more of his
conversation; accordingly I refrained at present from
striking a light, as the sound might awaken him, and
listened attentively.</p>

<p>I wondered much what could be the subject of the
sleeper's dream. I grew more and more puzzled at his
words. It is impossible for me to give you one
hundredth part of his conversation here, even if time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
permitted; for his utterance was so rapid that he would
have outstripped any shorthand writer.</p>

<p>Some part of his strange colloquy, however, I have
retained, as I fancied that in it I found reference to
myself.</p>

<p>"Fools!" he cried with vehemence; "I tell you
the prize is sure. I have him in my power, he <i>cannot</i>
escape me. Ye who prize blood rather than gold,
make ready the chasm to receive him. He is one of
those fools who delight in danger, and he will follow
me. What think ye? He seeks chasms and grottoes
for the insane pleasure of burdening himself with the
dross which we beings of a higher order tread under
foot. Crystals, fossils, shining stones, the ore of
different metals, especially gold and such trumpery, are
trifles that his mind (if such it may be called) revels in.</p>

<p>"Do you not believe me, my friends? Ha! ha!
I wonder not at your disbelief; ye whose sublime
philosophy is nourished in the peaceful bowels of the
earth, and who are therefore unable to comprehend how
there can exist an order of beings so totally degraded
and so approaching the brute, nay, so far surpassing
even the brutes themselves in the grossness of its
appetites, as to yearn for the very stones which form the
pavement and the walls of our subterranean palaces.</p>

<p>"Ye, my friends, who never issue from your cells to
visit that outer world, because, forsooth, your eyesight
is not formed by nature to endure the glare which
illumines the surface of this globe, how is it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that ye should believe that there exist without
intelligences so stunted and depraved? But I tell
you, my brothers in philosophy, that this fool belongs
to a race of maniacs, who have long attempted to invade
our peaceful shores, and even succeeded so far as to
penetrate nearly to the roofs of our dwellings&mdash;let us be
thankful that their frames are not suited to endure our
genial element below&mdash;with much labour, and for the
sole purpose of obtaining metal or some such rubbish
out of which they form&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tush! I do but waste time in attempting to
enumerate the countless uses to which these madmen
turn our paving stones. When ye are more at leisure,
if ye are content, I will relate to you some of the
incredible absurdities of those insects which crawl upon
the outward surface of our globe.</p>

<p>"At present, my brother gnomes, we have a great
work before us; our wants must be satisfied, and we
must adopt the means to satisfy them. We thirst for
blood, and we must have it. This fool loves to feast
his eyes upon gold, and gold he shall see by the stratum.
He but barters his blood for gold, after the fashion of
his own vile race. What else can he expect from us?</p>

<p>"It is not often, my friends, that we have a feast
of blood. Only now and then when some stray
traveller falls into a crevice or impudently approaches
too near to the craters of Vesuvius and Etna, till he gets
suffocated by the fumes and falls senseless into our
maws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Happily for us, we are not so constituted as to
need sustenance to the extent of those gross gormandisers
of the upper world who, would you believe it, my
comrades, find it necessary to devour food three or
four times a day.</p>

<p>"Ah! well you may open your august eyes at the
mention of a vice so brutally preposterous. Thus it is
to be sons of clay. We, who are more finely organised
beings, of an essence more ethereal, are content to
allow ages to pass before we indulge our appetites with
a full meal; yet we, too, my brethren, need sustenance
sometimes.</p>

<p>"Again we are suffering from the pangs of hunger,
and we must be satisfied. Patience, my fellow sages
and students of those sublime and abstruse sciences
ignored by the gross intellects of our reptile neighbours,
patience, for to-morrow I bring you a feast of blood. I
have brought you blood before, and I will do so again.
It is for this that I have taken upon me the base form
of one of the vilest among their own vile race.</p>

<p>"My own comely shape by which I am known here
below is ill-suited to brook the atmosphere of the surface
world; therefore, partly to excite compassion, and consequently
disarm suspicion, I have adopted a loathsome
disguise, through which even ye, my friends, would fail
to recognise me. At this moment, while I am speaking,
the filthy clay that for your sakes I shall don to-morrow
lies in the chamber of the victim.</p>

<p>"I am so far able to free myself from it as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
speak with you in the spirit, but I much fear that the
sympathy which to some extent must exist between my
spirit and the fulsome mask that awaits me in the world
above, may so influence the organs of the foul body as
to cause it to correspond audibly to the voice of my
spirit, and so alarm the victim in whose chamber it
sleeps, and scare him into flight.</p>

<p>"Therefore my discourse must be brief. There is
no time to be lost. At once ye must commence to stir
up the internal fires in this earth's centre, and cause a
powerful earthquake. The external crust which these
mortals inhabit must crack and gape into chasms. I
will lead him into the mountains to-morrow when he
will be your prey; till then, farewell."</p>

<p>No sooner had the orator concluded his harangue
than I began to feel a curious sensation. It was as if
the floor on which I had been lying were lifted up
under me, and I felt myself rolling from side to side,
much in the same manner as if I were at sea. This
motion continued and increased, and was accompanied
by a low rumbling sound. After a time this grew
louder, and I heard an explosion, and then a heavy
crash, as if the mountains were being riven asunder,
and were now toppling headlong into the valleys,
sweeping away whole villages with a force inconceivable.</p>

<p>The whole ch&acirc;let rocked like an open boat in a
storm. I was panic struck, and trembled in every limb.
It was then really true all that I had seen and heard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it was no disordered dream. The gnomes were really
at work.</p>

<p>Louder and louder grew the rumbling. Crash
followed upon crash. All the inmates of the ch&acirc;let
were aroused, and screams of women and children
resounded from every quarter. I sprang to my feet,
hurriedly donned my coat and boots, and rushed out of
the hut, but my fiendish companion was at my heels.</p>

<p>Upon gaining the outside of the cottage I found the
face of the country much changed. Huge crags had
been loosened, and tumbled quite close to us. Many
ch&acirc;lets had been completely crushed under them, and
as far as the eye could see all was one scene of
desolation.</p>

<p>The terror and the consternation of my poor hostess
was pitiable. She gathered her children together as a
hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and remained
stupefied with despair.</p>

<p>As for myself, having escaped the danger of being
crushed alive, my only thought now was to escape my
tormentor in the best way I could. The earthquake
was at an end, so I strode on in the direction I had
followed on the previous day, taking advantage of the
momentary absence of the dwarf, who had entered the
hut for some purpose or other, and imagined for a
moment that I should not be overtaken. Alas! vain
hope; hardly had I proceeded for ten minutes, when I
heard steps behind me, and lo! there was the hideous
elf running after me on all fours, his physical conformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rendering this mode of progression the easiest. I
started, and my blood ran cold.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I asked, angrily, still
striding on.</p>

<p>But it was useless. Raising himself on his short
legs, he beckoned to me, and I immediately felt myself
spellbound.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he signed with a gesture.</p>

<p>"I do not want a guide," I replied. "I am neither
in search of crystals, fossils, nor of shining stones; no,
nor even of gold."</p>

<p>"Never mind," he seemed to say; "come all the
same; I will show you what the earthquake has done."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you; but I have seen
enough of the earthquake, and I repeat I do not want
a guide."</p>

<p>"I do not want your money; I will follow you for
friendship," he appeared to say.</p>

<p>"Not even for friendship," I said; "I prefer to walk
alone."</p>

<p>"What!" he intimated, "when you can get a companion
for nothing?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see, my good man," said I, "that your
presence is a bore to me&mdash;that I'd rather be alone?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, yesterday evening you were glad
enough of a guide, and I asked you for no reward for
my trouble," he seemed to say with his eye.</p>

<p>"It is false," I replied; "I did not want a guide.
I could have found the hut myself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is ungrateful," he said, in his dumb manner.
"Did you not ask me?"</p>

<p>"If I asked you," I replied, "I did so for the sake
of not passing you without a word; besides, I offered
you money, and you refused it. I won't be under any
obligation to you," said I. "Here, take your nuggets;
I want them not," and I threw them at him. "I'll have
nothing to do with one who feigns to be dumb in the
daytime, and yet can talk well enough at night."</p>

<p>The cr&ecirc;tin gazed scrutinisingly at me for some
time, as much as to say, "Ha! ha! my friend, you
have overheard my discourse. I thought as much, but
no matter; escape me if you can."</p>

<p>He then walked rapidly on in front of me with his
short legs, every now and then beckoning to me with
his long arms, and I immediately felt myself impelled
by a power not my own, and found myself forced to
follow the wretch in spite of all my efforts.</p>

<p>"I will not, I will <i>not</i> follow you like a victim to the
altar," I cried, straining every nerve to control myself.
"Vile gnome, thou shalt <i>not</i> feast on <i>my</i> blood!"</p>

<p>The fiend nodded his huge head slowly with a complacent
smile, as if to say, "We shall see, we shall see."</p>

<p>On, and still on, up, further up the mountain,
through thick pine forests and gigantic clumps of rock
the demon guide led his unresisting prey. Breathless,
footsore, over the most impassable places the relentless
fiend magnetically dragged me after him; at a rate, too,
that thoroughly surprised me; until, to my horror, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
found myself close to a deep chasm formed in the rock
by the late earthquake.</p>

<p>The demon halted, and now speaking for the first
time since our walk together, he asked with a malicious
smile if I desired any fossils or any gold, observing that
all sorts of curiosities were to be found down there.
He then made a strange gesture with his hand towards
my face, and I suddenly perceived I was under a spell.</p>

<p>I had no memory of anything that had happened
up to that time. I bore no malice against my guide;
on the contrary, he appeared to me my best friend.
He did not even seem any longer ugly in my eyes, and
when he asked me if I would descend into the chasm, I
replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes; but how shall we manage it?"</p>

<p>"I have brought a rope on purpose," said my
friend.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said I.</p>

<p>He then began to unwind a long rope from his
waist, and adjusted it underneath my shoulders.</p>

<p>I then descended gradually, my companion holding
the rope and letting it out by degrees, until I had
descended a very considerable distance, when he
fastened the other end to a stump. I then began chipping
out various geological specimens, and experienced
an intense delight in my novel situation.</p>

<p>Soon, however, while busily occupied in extracting a
bone of an ichthyosaurus, I was interrupted by a cry
of many voices from below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Secure the victim! Down with him, down with
him! Our feast of blood is at hand."</p>

<p>Then followed a hungry roar, as of wild beasts
unfed. The charm was broken in an instant, and I
awoke to a sense of my awful position. To drop my
hammer and clamber up the rope as fast as I could
was my first step; but what was my horror, when, on
raising my eyes aloft, I descried the fiend in the act of
deliberately cutting the rope. How fortunate I happened
to look upwards just at that moment.</p>

<p>The rope was already half cut through; in another
moment I must have been launched into the abyss, to
be devoured by the bloodthirsty monsters below.
There was no time to lose; I was desperate, so thrusting
one foot into a chink in the walls of the chasm, I
looked about for another, then for some projecting
stone to grasp hold of, and thus by slow degrees, at the
imminent peril of my life, I climbed up until I gained
the ledge of the chasm.</p>

<p>It was a terrific struggle for life. The rope was of
immense length, and, deep as I had descended, there
was yet an immeasurable gulf below me. The darkness
of the chasm prevented the gnome above from
seeing his victim, though I could see him well enough.
When he severed the rope he knew none other than
that I had already been precipitated into the maws of
the gnomes below. When, therefore, lacerated and
exhausted, I reappeared at the top, the utmost consternation
and chagrin were visible in the features of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
wretch. Too astonished, perhaps, to think of working
another charm upon me, the ogre pounced upon me
like a tiger on his prey, and a terrific tussle ensued&mdash;a
tussle for life and death.</p>

<p>I soon found I was no match for my misshapen,
but powerful, adversary. I was soon worsted. Every
moment I expected to be my last.</p>

<p>"Can the Almighty allow the fiends to triumph over
His own?" I asked myself, in my dying moments.</p>

<p>I offered up a short prayer, and gave myself up for
lost. Suddenly a crash. A huge mass of rock above
me had loosened. The demon let go his hold to save
himself, but it was too late.</p>

<p>The deformed body of the cr&ecirc;tin lay crushed beneath
the weight of the enormous fragment.</p>

<p>I myself escaped with but a slight graze on the
head and shoulder. Had I been one whit less active, I
must have shared the fate of my guide. For a moment
I stood rooted to the spot, stupefied, bewildered; then,
offering up a prayer of thanksgiving for my miraculous
salvation, I departed on my way rejoicing.</p>

<p>The last sounds which rang in my ears were the
voices of the hungry gnomes, calling out, "Give us our
victim; we famish."</p>

<p>But I heeded them not, and continued my journey
with a buoyant step. I had a long and tedious walk
before me. At sundown, however, I reached the hotel
from which I had started.</p>

<p>My friend, of course, had not arrived, as I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
returned before the time specified. I know not how it
was, whether from the effects of over-fatigue or excessive
fright, but I was seized immediately upon my
arrival with a prolonged illness. A leech was sent for,
the best that the mountains could produce, and after
feeling my pulse and looking at my tongue, shook his
head gravely. He asked me the symptoms of my case,
and to what I attributed it. I told him the story that
I have just retailed to you, gentlemen; but he only
shook his head again, and said that I was in a high state
of fever, that these ravings were but the offspring of
delirium, that I had been deluded by my senses, etc.
But I knew better, for previous to meeting with the
monster I had never enjoyed better health in my life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Need the reader be told that at the conclusion of
this narrative the professor was greeted with murmurs
of applause from his gratified audience?</p>

<p>"Well, Helen," said our artist, to his fair neighbour,
"what do you think of the professor's story?"</p>

<p>The maiden blushed, and smilingly replied in a low
voice, that she liked it very much, and then added,
"And are there really those horrid what-ye-call-ums
that eat up poor gentlemen all alive?"</p>

<p>"So the professor says," replied Mr. Oldstone.
"You would not doubt his word, would you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not for a moment, sir," said the girl; "but
how dreadful; I'm sure I shall dream horribly to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you won't, my dear," said Mr. Crucible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
"Don't be afraid; and, I say, Miss Helen, don't you
think you could tell us a story? I am sure Mr.
Blackdeed, who comes next on the list, will yield his
turn to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," said the tragedian; "only too
happy; besides, it is not every day our club is honoured
by a lady."</p>

<p>"There now, lass," said Captain Toughyarn, "if I
may be allowed to put in my marling spike, that's the
prettiest little compliment you've shipped this many a
day. Come, sail along. What! afraid to set sail
alongside big ships like ours? Bah! When I was a
little craft of your tonnage I did not want so much
towing when asked for a yarn."</p>

<p>"The Captain's nautical language confuses the
young lady," observed Mr. Hardcase.</p>

<p>"Come, don't blush like that, Helen," said Dr.
Bleedem, "or I shall think you've got the scarlet fever,
and shall be obliged to bleed you."</p>

<p>"Fairest of thy sex," said little Mr. Jollytoast, going
down on one knee before the maiden and placing his
hand on his heart in the manner of a stage lover, which
added to the girl's confusion ten-fold; "say not nay,
prithee, say not nay."</p>

<p>"Come, Jollytoast," said Parnassus, "see you not
that she will not be courted by importunities. Give
the muse time for inspiration."</p>

<p>The members desisted from further persecution, and
a slight pause ensued, which was broken by McGuilp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
who, squeezing the maiden's hand, whispered, "For
my sake, Helen."</p>

<p>The girl blushed deeper still, looked down, and a
subdued sigh might have been noticed by the observer.</p>

<p>At length she looked up imploringly, and said,
"But what story shall I tell? I know none."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Come, think," said various
members at once.</p>

<p>The girl appeared thoughtful for some moments,
then, after giving a half-bashful smile at our artist,
turned towards the company, and said, "I will tell you
one that my grandmother told me when I was a little
thing, if you would care to hear it."</p>

<p>"Too delighted, Helen," said several voices.</p>

<p>The maiden, blushing slightly, and looking down,
timidly began her story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>The Pigmy Queen; A Fairy Tale.&mdash;The Landlord's
Daughter's Story.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;I think, in Germany, grandmother
said that it happened; but I am not quite sure;
perhaps it never happened at all; but if it did, it was
very far off, and a long time ago, that there lived a very
wicked king, who, to increase his power, had leagued
himself with the evil one, and used to practise witchcraft.
All sorts of witches and wizards were encouraged
at his court, and the land soon became unsufferable.
Many wealthy citizens being persecuted by the malice
of these creatures, fled the country.</p>

<p>It happened one day, however, in the very midst of
his crimes, that the bad king died, and was succeeded
by his son, who proved in every respect the very reverse
of his father. He was a good man, of a peaceful and
amiable disposition, and who had received an education
far superior to that given generally to the laity at that
time.</p>

<p>He had married lately a foreign princess of great
wit and beauty, and on ascending the throne his first
act was to rid his realm of all the witches and wizards
which had infested it in his father's time. He threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with death all those who should be found in the land
after ten days.</p>

<p>These tidings were received with murmurs of disapprobation
by all these wicked people, who would fain
have wrought a charm upon the king to kill him,
if they could; but the king, being a good man, was
under the protection of the good fairies. Nevertheless,
the populace were delighted at this determination
of their monarch's, having known nothing but oppression
and persecution under the reign of the late
king.</p>

<p>A few days after the good king had given out his
stern edict he was seated on his throne, with his consort
beside him, when he was informed that a poor woman
without desired to speak with him.</p>

<p>The king, ever open to compassion, imagining it to
be some poor widow oppressed by an unfeeling and dishonest
tyrant, who sought redress for her wrongs,
ordered her to be admitted into his presence. The
guards accordingly made way for her, and a wild,
ragged, squalid, and malignant-looking beldame prostrated
herself at the monarch's feet.</p>

<p>"O king," she pleaded, "thou who art great and
mighty, have mercy on the poor and houseless, and
cease to persecute those that do thee no harm. Know
that I am queen of the witches, a race much patronised
by thy late father of blessed memory, and who were
accounted worthy to dine at his table and be his constant
companions."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>To which the good king replied, "My father's
reign is over. Another and more virtuous king now
rules the land. My father encouraged the evil, I the
good. Ye have heard our order; our word is irrevocable."</p>

<p>Then the hag prostrated herself before the queen,
and begged with much fervour that she should intercede
with the king for her, that he might milden her sentence.</p>

<p>But the queen replied, "I have no other will than
that of my husband, whose sole desire it is to benefit
his country by exterminating the wicked. If I granted
your request I should be an enemy to my country."</p>

<p>Then the witch queen, rising to her feet and
standing erect, spake to the queen and said, "For this
inclemency I curse both thee and thy husband; and
thy firstborn daughter whom thou shall shortly bring
into the world shall be a dwarf, and shall know much
tribulation."</p>

<p>At these words the queen was seized with great
grief, and the king's ire being roused, he commanded
his guards to conduct the hag from his presence.
Hardly had she departed when a bright light filled
the palace and the queen of the fairies appeared in a
chariot drawn by butterflies, and assured the king and
queen that the blessings they should enjoy as a reward
for not granting the witch's request should counterbalance
the curses of the witch.</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried her majesty, "then the witch's
curse cannot be annulled?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not entirely," quoth the fairy queen, "but it can
be so modified that you shall feel it but little. The
witch has declared that your daughter shall be a dwarf,
and dwarf she shall be; and that, too, of so diminutive
a stature, as not to exceed a span in height. Nevertheless,
I will bequeath to her extraordinary beauty and
talents, and she shall reign long over a contented
people. Great adventures she will have to go through
first, but her good judgement will cause her to surmount
all obstacles. Furthermore, ye shall have nothing to
regret during your lifetime than that your daughter's
stature is not equal to that of other mortals."</p>

<p>With these words the good fairy disappeared.</p>

<p>In due time the queen was brought to bed of a
female child, so tiny that it was hardly the length of
the first joint of the queen's forefinger, but withal of
such surprising beauty that the fame thereof spread
throughout all the land.</p>

<p>The child grew and increased each day in beauty,
until it reached its full growth of one span in height.</p>

<p>About a year after the birth of the young princess
the queen was again confined of twins, both girls, rosy
and healthy of the average size of babes.</p>

<p>As the three sisters grew up their mother did her
best to instruct them in those duties which should fit
them for good princesses, as well as good wives and
mothers, when a fever then raging through the land&mdash;probably
part of the witch's curse&mdash;carried off the good
king and queen almost at the same time, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
eldest princess was scarce eighteen, and the three
children were left in charge of a guardian.</p>

<p>Now, as there was no male issue, the Princess Bertha
(the name of the firstborn) had every right to the
throne. This she knew, nor ever deemed that her right
would be disputed; but her younger sisters, who were
neither so good nor so beautiful as their elder one, were
suddenly seized with envy, and began to plot together
in what manner they could secure the crown for themselves.
They had never loved their sister nor each
other, but they both agreed that the rightful heiress was
to be deposed, while each of the twin sisters vaunted
herself most fit to govern the country.</p>

<p>Neither of them had the least intention of yielding
the crown to the other, though both saw the necessity
of wresting it from the lawful heiress, as they said it
would be absurd to permit such a farce as a dwarf
queen to rule over them. Now, this led to a very
hot discussion, which the Princess Bertha, who was
concealed from them in some nook in the chamber,
happened to overhear.</p>

<p>This envy of her sisters grieved her very much.
She herself was not ambitious, and had her sisters been
good to her, she would willingly have ceded the crown
to them, but seeing their envy, her just indignation was
roused, and she was determined not to be thrust aside
because she was little of stature, so striding majestically
up to them, and drawing herself up to the full extent of
her tiny height, she angrily accosted them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is it, sisters, that envy has filled your hearts,
and that ye meditate an act of injustice? Know ye
not that I am your lawful sovereign? The crown is
mine; I will yield it to no one."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried both the sisters, with a laugh; "you
could not wear it."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Bertha. "I will have one made
on purpose."</p>

<p>"You!" answered one of the sisters. "Shall we
have a dwarf to reign over us?"</p>

<p>"What has my stature to do with my lawful right to
the crown?" quoth the elder. "Think you that I am
an idiot as well as a dwarf? Have I not abilities equal
to yours&mdash;nay, superior. Come, don't let me hear any
more of this silly bickering, or I shall find means to
punish you both."</p>

<p>These big words, proceeding from such a small body,
and from one, too, who had never showed herself of an
imperious disposition, but had hitherto allowed herself
to be trampled upon and set at nought by them without
a murmur, half-startled the twin sisters, and half-provoked
their mirth.</p>

<p>They were enraged at such words being used
towards them by one whom they thought fit to despise,
and knew not what to answer, so they only looked at
one another.</p>

<p>Now, there was something in that look which told
Bertha that her sisters would make very little to-do
about silencing her for ever, if she did not remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
quiet; and being so small a personage, to murder her
and conceal the murder would be a matter of small
difficulty, so she prudently withdrew. But no time was
to be lost; one of her sisters might be proclaimed
queen if she did not engage the people on her side.
So, wending her tiny steps to the foot of the palace
stairs, she hid herself behind the hall door.</p>

<p>Now, in the hall were two serving men, who were
discussing as to which of the twin sisters should wear
the crown.</p>

<p>"Of course," said one, "the poor little dwarf
princess won't have a chance."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the other. "She is the firstborn."</p>

<p>"True," said the first; "if she had her rights, but
you'll find that some day she will be found missing,
and not likely to turn up again."</p>

<p>"What! you don't mean to say that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the other, putting his finger to his lips.</p>

<p>Now, the Princess Bertha had heard enough of this
conversation to make her wary, and perceiving that one
of the serving men had his hat on and appeared about
to leave the palace, she managed to creep unseen
behind his chair, and climbed up into his pocket.
Shortly afterwards the serving man rose up to go, and
left the palace.</p>

<p>Then the pigmy princess, whilst snugly ensconced
in the man's pocket as he walked along the street, began
to reflect what should be her next step.</p>

<p>"Within the palace," she said to herself, "all is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
scheming and envy. I am easily put out of the way
when they once get me. I must escape far from the
palace and put myself under the protection of the
people. At any rate, I'll first have a peep at the world
without."</p>

<p>So, thrusting her little head out of the man's pocket,
she looked to the right and the left, and found herself
in the middle of a large square. There was a great
crowd of people, who were looking at a puppet show.
The serving man whose pocket she was in also stood
still to look. She, too, seized with curiosity, strained
her head out of the pocket to take a peep at the puppets.</p>

<p>A play was being acted in which two puppet
knights were fighting for the love of a fair lady. A
sudden thought struck her. She would join the
puppets and mix in the play; it would be a way of
showing herself to the public. So she stole out of the
serving man's pocket, and taking advantage of the
people's absorbing interest in the play, crept stealthily
over their feet, till she came to a box full of puppets on
the ground. The uppermost puppet in the box was a
lady, gaily attired, probably the very lady for whom the
puppet knights were fighting, so she laid herself over
the body of the doll, so as to be taken by the man when
he wanted her, instead of the usual puppet.</p>

<p>The very next moment the showman, who now had
to bring the lady on the scene, reached down his hand
without looking, and seizing the princess in lieu of the
wooden doll, brought her upon the stage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cease your broils," shouted the pigmy princess in
her tiny voice. "Is it thus that noble knights waste
their precious blood for the love of a woman? Is not
the love of a woman at her own disposal&mdash;to be granted
to the man she pleases? Will she necessarily love the
victor, or will he have the arrogance to think that he
can conquer her heart as he could conquer a foe?
Cease, madmen, and spare your blood to grace the
battlefield, or to defend the rights of woman. Ye
are not too plentiful, my noble knights. The realm
has much need of ye.</p>

<p>"Wrongs enough ye have to redress. What say ye
to the grievous wrong they are trying to do the Princess
Bertha, by pushing her aside, who is the firstborn,
because they deem her too small to take her own part?
But ye noble knights, who love justice, will assert her
claim to the crown throughout the kingdom, and
defeat the insolent champions hired by her envious
sisters, who would defraud their own royal sovereign.</p>

<p>"Proclaim throughout the land that ye will have
none other to rule over you but the rightful heiress&mdash;the
Princess Bertha."</p>

<p>After the princess's harangue, the showman, who
had long dropped the other puppets in amazement,
believing that none other than a fairy trod his stage,
stood with his eyes and mouth wide open, knowing not
what to do. The spectators were in ecstasies at so
beautiful and so natural-looking a puppet, while the
crowd increased ten-fold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The serving man in whose pocket Bertha had
hidden herself had never seen the princess, for he was
not one of the servants of the palace; besides which,
the diminutive princess was usually hidden from the
vulgar gaze, the family being rather ashamed of her
than otherwise; but one among the crowd, who
happened to have seen the princess once or twice on
rare occasions at the palace, cried out, "By my troth,
that is the Princess Bertha herself, and none other!
How comes it that she is made a puppet of in this
man's vile show? Citizens, I arrest this man for high
treason!"</p>

<p>The little princess, seeing the showman in danger,
said to the gentleman, "No, worthy sir; do this man no
harm, seeing I came here by my own free will, without
his knowledge, for the purpose of making the country
acquainted with its future sovereign."</p>

<p>The gentleman pushed his way through the crowd,
and was about to lay his hand on the princess to bring
her back to the palace, when a monkey near at hand,
also the property of the showman, and who happened
at that moment to be loose, seized the diminutive
princess in his arms, and clambering up the side of a
house by the water spout, was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Now, when the news of this catastrophe reached the
palace, the twin princesses were delighted that harm
was likely to befall their elder sister, so that their
right to the throne might be no longer disputed;
nevertheless they ordered a strict search to be made for
the body of the little princess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Two parties, each headed by one of the princesses,
started in different directions to search for the missing
sister, but for a long time nothing was heard of her.
Wearied at length with long search, the Princess
Clothilde, one of the twins, gave out to her followers
that she had found the body of her elder sister, but
that it was so far decayed that she could not permit
anyone to see it; so, making believe to wrap up the
body of the princess with a handkerchief, she carried it
under her cloak and returned to the city, shedding false
tears as she went.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the palace, she ordered a coffin to
be made just large enough to contain the corpse she
was supposed to have found, and when it was ready she
filled it with rubbish and ordered it to be interred with
due honours.</p>

<p>Now, at that time there were two factions, one
voting for the Princess Clothilde and another for her
sister Carlotta. It was decided, therefore, that each
should choose a champion, and she whose champion
should prove victorious should rule the land.</p>

<p>Great were the preparations for this grand spectacle.
Two stalwart knights, the stoutest and the ablest that
the land could produce, each of whom had gained
great reputation for feats of arms, faced each other to
decide their cause. The day had arrived for the
combat, and the jousts were crowded with all the
great people of the land. The combatants appeared,
and charged at each other furiously, but the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fairies who had already prophesied that the Princess
Bertha should reign, willed not that either of the
champions should win, and they caused a thick mist to
rise between them, by which means they could neither
of them see the other; nor was the sound of their
horses' hoofs audible.</p>

<p>The spectators, finding that nothing could be
decided on that day, went away discontented, and the
fight was deferred till the next day. Again the
combatants appeared in the lists, and no obstacle
seemed likely to interfere with the combat; but at the
moment they commenced to charge at one another the
good fairies, through their art, rendered their horses so
ungovernable that each knight had enough to do to
preserve his seat, and this continued all day.</p>

<p>A second time the spectators were disappointed,
but they insisted upon the champions making a third
trial. The third day arrived, but with no better success,
for this time the fairies struck both knights and both
horses with paralysis, so that neither could move an
inch, but stood looking at each other all day, like two
fools.</p>

<p>At first the people laughed at so droll a sight, but at
length getting impatient, they heaped showers of abuse
upon the two champions, calling them fools and
cowards to be afraid of one another. Other champions
at length took the place of the former, but the good
fairies again interfered, using all sorts of impediments,
so that neither could vanquish the other, and this lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for many days, until the people despaired of ever witnessing
a fight again.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the Princess Bertha. The
fright that she experienced at finding herself in the
grasp of this horrid monkey caused her to swoon away
but on recovering her senses she found herself on the
top of a tree in the midst of a forest, still in the
monkey's grasp. It was out of her power to escape, so
she thought she would try and ingratiate herself with
her captor, so she said, "Good monkey, do me no
harm, for I am a king's daughter and the rightful
heiress to the crown. When I am queen I will grant
you any boon you ask."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said the monkey; "I will hold you to
your promise, for I am not a common monkey, but an
enchanted prince, forced to wear this loathsome form
through the malice of the witch queen in the reign of
the late king, because I would not wed her daughter."</p>

<p>"Alas! poor monkey," said the princess, "and how
long art thou doomed to wander about the earth in this
disguise?"</p>

<p>"Until the death of the witch queen," said the
monkey, "when I shall resume my customary shape."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the princess, "there is then hope that I
may yet attain to the stature of my fellow mortals, for
I, too, am under her curse."</p>

<p>While thus discoursing together a passer-by, perceiving
the monkey in the tree, but without seeing the
princess, aimed a stone at the poor ape with such force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
on the back of its head, that it fell senseless to the foot
of the tree. The princess deeming the animal dead,
grieved much for it, and called after the man who
threw the stone, scolding him; but her tiny voice was
unheard, and the man was already far off.</p>

<p>Left alone on the top of a tree in the middle of a
forest, what could she do? She began to look around
her, and on the next branch she saw a crow hatching
her eggs.</p>

<p>"Good crow," she said, "I am a king's daughter,
have pity on me and carry me on thy back to a stream,
for I thirst."</p>

<p>"I will carry you thus far," said the crow, "if you
promise to grant me a boon when you wear the crown,
for I am not a common crow, but an enchanted queen
suffering under the evil spell of the queen of the
witches."</p>

<p>When the princess had promised to grant her
request the crow suffered her to mount on her back,
and away she flew till she came to a winding stream,
where she left the princess, saying, "I must now return
to my eggs."</p>

<p>The princess having quenched her thirst, began to
reflect upon the step she should next take. She knew
not which way to wander, and did not care much, as
long as it was far away from her sisters. She knew that
the good fairies protected her, and believed in their
promise that she should be queen. Whatever hardships
she might have to encounter she made up her mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were for her good. All day long she wandered by the
side of the stream, over the rough stones, with her tiny
feet, subsisting on berries and roots, and thus she
wandered for some days without adventure.</p>

<p>At length, one day, having arrived at the top of a
high cliff which overhung a lake, and which she had
ascended to see the country that lay before her, her
dress caught in a thicket, and she heard the sound of
horses' hoofs behind her. It happened on that day that
her two sisters had joined a hunting party and passed by
in that direction.</p>

<p>The rest of the party passed over without observing
her, but her sister Clothilde, who was behind the rest,
suddenly caught sight of the little princess's shining
robe, and dismounting, came up to her, saying, "So I
have found thee at last, minx; but think not to live to
prove my tale false," and with that she spurned her
pigmy sister with her foot, so that she fell over the cliff.</p>

<p>A stone which she dislodged at the same time fell
into the water with a splash, and Clothilde, fancying
that it was her sister who caused the splash, and that
she was now hidden for ever at the bottom of the
lake, rode off, rejoicing that she had rid herself so
cleverly of her hated rival.</p>

<p>But the Princess Bertha, instead of falling into the
water, was caught half-way in the web of an enormous
spider, who made towards her as if to devour her; but
she said, "Good spider, harm me not for I am a king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
daughter, and when I am queen I will grant thee
whatsoever boon thou askest."</p>

<p>"I will remember thy promise," said the spider,
"for I am no common spider, but an enchanted prince,
and a victim to the malice of the witch queen."</p>

<p>Thereupon the spider seized her gently with its legs,
and letting out its thread, descended carefully with her
to the bottom of the cliff. Then the spider left her,
and she was once more alone on the brink of the lake.</p>

<p>Presently she heard the sound of a woodcutter's
axe on the opposite bank of the lake. She would
speak with the woodcutter, and tell him her tale;
perhaps he could help her, but how was she to cross?
She looked around for a moment, and saw some
water lilies. One of the leaves was detached and
seemed floating slowly on by itself. This she managed
to reach, and it was sufficiently strong to support her
light form; then, spreading out the scarf that covered
her shoulders towards the wind for a sail, she was
slowly wafted to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Now, as she was about to land, it happened that
her foot slipped and she fell into the water, uttering a
slight scream. The woodcutter, who was resting from
his work, had his eyes fixed on the lake, and perceived
with surprise the pigmy princess sailing towards the
shore. When, therefore, he heard the scream, small
as it was, he rushed down the bank and seized her
slight form in his huge hand. The princess, however,
was already insensible, but the good man wrung her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
clothes dry and kept her in his bosom until she should
recover. Now, during her swoon the queen of the
fairies appeared to her in a dream, and told her that the
woodcutter was the man she was destined to marry
and to go at once with him to a cave hard by where
lived a holy hermit, whom she had already commissioned
to marry them.</p>

<p>Then, leaving her a magic wand which changed
any object she touched into whatever she pleased, she
disappeared, enjoining her to use her own judgement
in everything.</p>

<p>Upon this she awoke, and found herself still in the
woodcutter's bosom. Now, the woodcutter was a young
man of a stature approaching the gigantic, immensely
powerful, but very ugly, very clumsy, and very stupid.
At the first sight of him the princess recoiled, and could
not make up her mind to take him for a husband; but
then she thought that the fairies must know best what
was for her good, so she reversed the generally received
order of etiquette and made him a proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>The young man simpered, scratched his head, and
looked very sheepish; but having heard the princess's
story, and being assured by her that the fairies had
ordained it so, he turned away his head, blushed, and
accepted her.</p>

<p>Then the princess, finding the magic wand beside
her, waved it over her head, and instantly converted the
peasant's ragged clothes into a suit of mail, his axe into
a lance, a knife that he wore at his side into a sword;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
while the tree that he had just felled, she converted into
a magnificent charger. She then bade him mount and
place her within his helmet, close to his ear, so that she
could give him any instructions that might be
necessary without being observed by anyone.</p>

<p>Then asking Hans (which was the name of the
transformed woodcutter) whether he knew where the
hermit lived whom the fairy had mentioned, and receiving
an answer in the affirmative, she bade him put spurs to
his horse, and in a short time they arrived at the mouth
of the cave. The recluse rose to meet the man in
armour.</p>

<p>"Good day, fair son," quoth the holy man. "What
would'st thou of me?"</p>

<p>"Holy father," said the knight, "I have come to get married."</p>

<p>"And the fair bride?" asked the hermit.</p>

<p>"She is with me."</p>

<p>"With thee! I see her not."</p>

<p>"Here, holy father, here," cried the princess,
emerging from the helmet of Hans. "I am the
Princess Bertha, and have been commanded by the
fairies in a dream to call at thy cell with my betrothed
that we may be joined together in holy matrimony."</p>

<p>"I know it, O illustrious princess," said the hermit,
with deep reverence; "and doubt not that I shall
discharge my duty. May it please your royal highness
to enter the abode of the humble?"</p>

<p>"Dismount!" cried Bertha in the ear of her
betrothed, suddenly, as if to wake him up, for the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
youth looked as if he intended to remain on the horse's
back all day.</p>

<p>Hans dismounted clumsily, and nearly tripped
himself up with his pointed iron toes.</p>

<p>"Now, then, tie up the horse to a tree and enter
the cave, and don't look such a fool," said the princess.</p>

<p>Hans entered the cave, and placed himself in front
of the rude altar, having unclasped his helmet and
deposited his bride on a large stone near.</p>

<p>The hermit lit candles, opened the mass-book, and
the ceremony began. As the moment for putting
on of the ring drew near, a faint and distant music,
together with a perfume like incense, seemed to fill the
cave. Then followed a bright sunbeam, through which
swam troops of fairies. Then the distant sound of
trumpets was heard, and the troop made way for the
chariot of the fairy queen, who, stepping out of her car
of mother-of-pearl and precious stones, and standing
upon a cloud of incense, handed Hans the wedding
ring, and bestowed a benediction on the happy pair.</p>

<p>It was no easy task for Hans' clumsy fingers to place
so small a ring upon so tiny a finger, but at length by
the aid of a needle brought to him for the purpose he
accomplished the feat, and the marriage ceremony over,
the knight and the lady rode off in the same fashion
as before.</p>

<p>Now, it may be thought by some, perhaps, that
these two were ill matched, but that only shows how
the whole world may be deceived by appearances, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
they were most admirably mated. It is true they had
little in common with each other, but for that very
reason in this case, at least, they pulled well together.
Bertha was physically weak, but then Hans was strong.
Hans was as stupid as an owl, but the princess was as
clear sighted as an eagle and as cunning as a fox.
Bertha possessed the brains and Hans the brawny
arm. Each was a type of those two items which go
to make up the most perfect human being&mdash;mind and
matter.</p>

<p>In this case the husband was not the head of the
wife, but the wife the head of the husband, and a very
clear little head it was, too. The princess was ever
concealed in her husband's helmet, close to his ear, to
give him sage councils, which he, as you shall hear
farther on, often had occasion to put into practise by
his superior physical strength.</p>

<p>The world would have chosen for Hans some rough
daughter of the soil, as stupid as himself, and as nearly
as possible of his own dimensions; but this sort of
wife, however well she might have suited Hans in his
former contented existence, would never have raised
him into the hero that he afterwards became.</p>

<p>The humble woodcutter, beneath his rough exterior,
had hidden seeds of greatness which were destined to
be developed in a new soil. Our knight and his lady
did not profess to love each other very much, just
because they were married; indeed, how should they
upon so short an acquaintance; but that was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
necessary, for love is one thing and marriage another,
as all the world knows. Enough, that each had need
of the other at present.</p>

<p>Now, the first thing to be done was to ride to the
city, and for Hans to proclaim the right of the Princess
Bertha to the throne; and should any other champion
come forward for either of the twin princesses, it was
meet that they should do battle for their cause.</p>

<p>"Therefore, Hans," said the princess, "ride quickly
to the town, and proclaim my rights. Pass over yonder
hill where stands a ruined castle."</p>

<p>"Let us not pass thither, fair princess," said Hans,
"for yon castle is inhabited by a terrible wizard, who
has lived here since the reign of your highness's grandsire,
who, you will have heard, rather encouraged these
sort of people than otherwise, and whom no power can
force to flee the country, for as soon as the king's guards
approach the castle he enchants them into rocks and fir
trees."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! we will see about that," said the Princess
Bertha. "So this man is a dangerous character. I do
not intend to allow any dangerous person when I am
queen. Come, we must subdue this man."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" remonstrated Hans.</p>

<p>"But me no buts, Sir Shaveling," quoth the princess,
"but do my bidding. Must I lend thee courage as well
as wit? Onward, I say."</p>

<p>Hans could ill brook being called a coward, and
that, too, by a woman&mdash;such a little woman, too&mdash;so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
crossing himself, he put spurs to his horse and ascended
the hill till he arrived at the gate of the castle.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> want?" said the wizard, suddenly
making his appearance at the window.</p>

<p>"Say," said the princess in the ear of her husband,
"that you have come in the name of the Princess
Bertha, our future queen, to bid him flee the country."</p>

<p>Hans cried out in a loud voice as he was instructed
by his spouse. The wizard answered with a loud laugh,
and descended the staircase.</p>

<p>Now, the princess knew that evil charms availed
not against good ones, so, touching her husband with
her wand, she thus made him proof against any magic
power of the wizard.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said the magician, descending; "you
will be no harder task to manage than the rest have
been, I'll warrant," and he proceeded to draw a circle
on the ground and to mumble a spell.</p>

<p>"Enough of this mummery," said Hans, at the
instigation of the princess. "Prepare to leave the country
at once, or you die."</p>

<p>"These words to <i>me</i>, you churl!" cried the wizard,
pale with rage. "Dost know who I am?"</p>

<p>"I know, and I defy you&mdash;both your arms and your
spells."</p>

<p>Then the wizard, mortified at finding that his charm
failed upon Hans, entered his castle in great wrath, put
on his armour, and came forth mounted on a black
charger with fiery eyes, and ran at Hans furiously with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
his lance, but the lance was shivered into splinters
against the magical armour of Hans.</p>

<p>The wizard then seized his two-handed sword, and
Hans seizing his, a terrific combat ensued. At length
Hans smote off the wizard's head at a blow, and the
bleeding carcase dropped from the saddle. At the
death of the wizard his fiery charger was instantly
changed into a fir tree, and his castle into a rock.</p>

<p>"On this spot," said Bertha, "I will erect my
palace," and waving her wand over the rock, a magnificent
palace arose where had stood the ruined castle of
the wizard, made of gold, silver and precious stones,
with windows, each pane of which was a sheet of
diamond.</p>

<p>Hans had hardly recovered his surprise at his unexpected
victory over the wizard, when he turned his head
and observed the magnificent palace that the princess
had magically erected. He stood aghast, with his eyes
and his mouth wide open, and seemed beside himself
with amazement.</p>

<p>"Onward, you fool; don't stand gaping there; onward
towards the town."</p>

<p>Hans clapped spurs to his horse, and halted not
until he arrived at the gate of the city.</p>

<p>Then entering, he stood in the middle of a large
square where there was a great crowd of people, and receiving
instructions from the princess, called out to
the populace: "I proclaim the Princess Bertha the
rightful heiress to the crown. Whoever would depose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
her and set another on the throne in her stead, let him
come forth and do battle."</p>

<p>Then some of the crowd cried out, "The Princess
Bertha is dead; we have seen her funeral. Who art
thou, that speakest so boldly?"</p>

<p>"I am the champion of the Princess Bertha, eldest
daughter of the late king, and whosoever says that
she is dead, lies."</p>

<p>So saying, he lifted his tiny spouse from his helmet
with finger and thumb, and showed her to the people.
Then a great commotion arose. There were some
among them who recognised the princess, and admitted
her right to the throne. Others said nay; that it was a
puppet, and voted for the Princess Clothilde. Others,
again, shouted for the Princess Carlotta.</p>

<p>Presently the two first champions appeared who had
fought together&mdash;one for Clothilde, and the other for
Carlotta, and they both called out, "We ignore your
Princess Bertha, for it is well known that she is dead.
In vain you exhibit your dwarf or puppet, for we have
seen her funeral."</p>

<p>"Then," said Hans, at the dictation of Bertha, "it
is false; the body was never found, but one of her
intriguing sisters, anxious to usurp the crown, gave out
to her followers that she had found the body, and
ordered a mock funeral."</p>

<p>"Thou liest, thou liest!" shouted the two knights,
both at once.</p>

<p>"Let it be put to the proof," said Hans. "Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
coffin be disinterred, and if the body be found therein
I will lose my head on the spot where I stand; but if
the body of the princess be not found therein, then
shall ye, the champions of the two usurpers, lose <i>your</i>
heads."</p>

<p>"It would be sacrilege to disturb the dead," said
the knights. "We cannot agree to the proposition."</p>

<p>But the people called out, "It is well said; 'tis a fair
trial."</p>

<p>The two knights began to remonstrate, but their
voices were drowned by the herd, who wished the matter
settled by the disinterment of the body.</p>

<p>When the commotion had ceased a little Hans
lifted up his voice, and said to the multitude, being instructed,
as usual, by his spouse, "It is the pleasure of
the Princess Bertha, whom you now see before you,
that she be taken instantly to the presence of the arch-priest
of this city, who has known her well from infancy,
and who baptised her. He, as you all know, citizens, is
a man of good repute. Should he recognise the Princess
Bertha, let her have her rights; but if he says it
is another like to her, let the coffin of the supposed
defunct be opened publicly, that all may be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Sacrilege, sacrilege!" cried the knights.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried the populace; "the stranger knight
has well said. It is most fair. To the arch-priest, to
the arch-priest!"</p>

<p>The crowd made room for Hans, and conducted
him to the palace of the arch-priest. When the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
man saw this great crowd in front of his palace he came
out to demand the reason, and was informed that the
Princess Bertha, whom all believed to be dead, had
returned to the city with a champion who was ready to
maintain her right to the crown, provided that the arch-priest
himself, who knew her well, should testify to her
identity.</p>

<p>"Show me this champion," said the priest.</p>

<p>Hans then rode up, and holding in his hand the
diminutive princess, placed her in the hands of the
arch-priest.</p>

<p>The crowd pressed hard together while the aged
priest took out his spectacles and examined the tender
form minutely.</p>

<p>"In good sooth," he exclaimed, "it is the Princess
Bertha and none other. My fair princess, what treachery
has been at work to deprive thee of thy rights?"</p>

<p>"You know me then, holy father?"</p>

<p>"Know thee, daughter," quoth the old man, tenderly.
"Methinks it were difficult to make a mistake."</p>

<p>"You hear then, O people," cried the little princess,
straining her feeble voice to its utmost pitch, till it
resembled the squeaking of a fife; "you hear that the
venerable arch-priest has recognised me."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, your royal highness; long life to you, and
welcome to the throne!" cried the populace.</p>

<p>Then a great cheering arose.</p>

<p>"Long live the Princess Bertha, our rightful queen!"</p>

<p>But some of the faction for the Princess Clothilde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
called out, "It is false; she is dead and buried, we will
not be imposed upon by this man and his dwarf."</p>

<p>"The arch-priest recognises her," cried others.
"The arch-priest dotes; he is mistaken," cried they for
the Princess Clothilde.</p>

<p>"Let the coffin of the princess be exhumed!" cried
the crowd, and they appealed to the priest, who consented
that the coffin should be opened in the presence
of all the people.</p>

<p>"Where is the undertaker?" cried one of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Here!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>"Let him come forward."</p>

<p>Then the crowd made room for the undertaker,
and one amongst them asked him if he had placed the
late princess in the coffin with his own hands.</p>

<p>He replied in the negative.</p>

<p>"Who closed the coffin, then?" asked the former
questioner.</p>

<p>"The Princess Clothilde herself," answered the
undertaker.</p>

<p>"That seems suspicious," said another; "she also is
said to have found the body, which she concealed in
her cloak and allowed nobody to see."</p>

<p>"Because," answered one of the faction, for
Clothilde, "because the body, being already in an
advanced state of decay, she was unwilling to make a
disgusting exhibition of the remains of her sister, who
she so dearly loved. We are witnesses of her emotion
upon finding her sister's body."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is false," cried Hans; "the Princess Clothilde
is a hypocrite and an usurper, and has plotted to obtain
the crown for herself."</p>

<p>"Treason, treason!" cried the faction for Clothilde.
But those in favour of the Princess Bertha applauded
the words of Hans, and cried out, "We shall see if the
remains be in the coffin."</p>

<p>After waiting some little time longer, the coffin was
exhumed and given into the hands of the arch-priest,
who, standing upon the balcony of his palace, opened
the coffin with his penknife in the presence of all the
crowd, and found therein nothing but cinders, which he
emptied into the street below.</p>

<p>"I hope now, citizens, you are convinced that foul
play is at the bottom of it all," said the old priest.</p>

<p>"Ay," cried the crowd, "most vile treachery&mdash;down
with the Princess Clothilde; we will have none to reign
over us but the Princess Bertha."</p>

<p>"Stay a moment," shouted the champion for the
Princess Clothilde. "What was there in the coffin if
not the body of the Princess Bertha?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but dust and ashes," answered the
arch-priest.</p>

<p>"A sign that decomposition has already taken
place," responded the former. "That is no proof that
the princess Bertha was not buried in the coffin."</p>

<p>But the crowd laughed him to scorn, saying that it
was scarce a fortnight ago since the princess was missed,
and that it was impossible the body should have
decomposed so rapidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The arch-priest then gave his word of honour to all
present that he had found nothing in the coffin but
cinders from the grate.</p>

<p>One of the crowd below picked up a cinder
which had fallen from the coffin, and cried out, "The
holy father speaks the truth, for the coffin contained
nothing but cinders of burnt wood."</p>

<p>Then the champion for the Princess Clothilde,
fearing that all were siding with Bertha, called out in a
loud voice, "Long live the Princess Clothilde!"</p>

<p>But the crowd hissed, and showed signs of
disapprobation.</p>

<p>Then the other champion for her twin sister called
out, "Long live the Princess Carlotta!" but he, too,
was hissed.</p>

<p>Then spake out Hans.</p>

<p>"Whoever objects to the Princess Bertha being
queen, let him do battle with me."</p>

<p>Hans then threw down his gauntlet, which was
immediately picked up by Clothilde's champion.</p>

<p>Our little princess took refuge once more in her
husband's helmet, and whispered in his ear to keep his
lance steadily directed towards the breast of his foe,
and then, touching him with the wand again, she
rendered him proof against all mortal harm.</p>

<p>The adversaries charged together, and so violent was
the shock with which Hans came upon his foe, and so
accurately did he direct his lance, that the deadly
weapon pierced through the massive breast plate of his
enemy and came out at his back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans, whose natural strength was terrific, and which
was increased ten-fold by the magical touch he had
received from his spouse, whirled the dead champion
at the point of his lance two or three times round his
head, and then flung the body to an incredible distance
over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>The champion of the Princess Carlotta, seeing the
fate of the other champion, would fain have drawn back,
for he thought Hans could be none other than the foul
fiend himself.</p>

<p>But the crowd cried out to him, "Thou, too, votest
for the Princess Carlotta."</p>

<p>"Ay," he was constrained to say.</p>

<p>"Do battle for her, then," said Hans.</p>

<p>Carlotta's champion sullenly laid his lance in rest,
and aimed at a portion of Hans' vast body which seemed
least protected; but the point of his lance got entangled
in the shirt of mail that Hans wore beneath his plate
armour without doing further injury to him, while Hans'
lance pierced through the left eye of his foe, and passing
through the back of his skull, helmet and all, pinned
him to the ground, whilst his horse galloped off through
the crowd.</p>

<p>Now, the news of the return of their sister and the
defeat of their champions soon reached the ears of the
twin princesses, who knew not how to contain their
rage; but the Princess Clothilde, the more wily and
wicked of the two, bribed her followers with large sums
of money to feign to vote for the Princess Bertha, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thus make friends with this stranger knight, and invite
him into their houses, to offer him a cup of wine after
the fatigue of the combat, which, when unobserved,
she commanded them to drug, and as soon as he was
insensible he was to be carried off to prison and loaded
with chains, care being taken to secure the Princess
Bertha at the same time.</p>

<p>Hereupon all those who had formerly voted for the
Princess Clothilde commenced to shout, "Long live the
Princess Bertha!"</p>

<p>But the little princess, suspecting treachery&mdash;for she
recognised the faces of the men who now shouted for
her as being the same as before shouted for her sister&mdash;warned
her spouse not to receive any man's hospitality
but the arch-priest's, telling him that if he disobeyed her
command it might cost him his life.</p>

<p>Hans promised to obey, but when he saw so many
well-dressed gentlemen of the court come forward to
offer him their congratulations and invite him so cordially
to their houses, being very simple and unsuspicious,
he forgot the warning of his spouse, though she
did all in her power by pinching and biting him to
make him remember, and he accepted the invitation
of a certain lord, imagining his spouse's vehement urging
to be nothing more than the bite of a flea.</p>

<p>"Fool!" cried the princess, "you will ruin both
yourself and me;" but Hans paid no attention, for he
was hungry and thirsty.</p>

<p>The great lord who had invited Hans to his mansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
possessed all the polished manners of a courtier, though
he had a very black heart, and easily working himself
into Hans' affections, he locked his arm within the arm
of Hans, and led him to his home.</p>

<p>"May I also have the honour of entertaining Her
Royal Highness the Princess Bertha?" asked the
nobleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Hans in his simple manner; "she
is inside my helmet. I'll bring her, too. You see, she
being small and I being large, it is the only way we can
discourse together."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the nobleman; "an original
idea. By all means let me have the honour of entertaining
my princess."</p>

<p>Hans was charmed at the affable manners of the
nobleman, and arrived at the mansion, took a seat at
the lord's table, where he was introduced to other men
of high rank, who all congratulated him on his prowess,
and expressed their delight at having made his acquaintance.</p>

<p>A meal was speedily prepared, and wine handed
round.</p>

<p>"Drink not," whispered the princess. But Hans,
deaf to all counsel in the presence of so many genial
companions, accepted glass after glass, until he was in a
state bordering on intoxication. Now, Hans was a good
man, and a true, but he had one small failing, which
was an inclination to tipple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>He could never refuse a good glass of wine when
he was among boon companions. He had also a most
ravenous appetite, and afforded the other guests much
amusement by the clownish manner in which he
devoured his food, as well as by his brutal stupidity and
broad peasant's brogue.</p>

<p>When the wine had loosened his tongue a little he
soon informed the nobleman of his former condition,
saying he was no knight of the court, but a humble
woodcutter, and would take no notice of the signs made
to him by the princess to keep quiet (who now, by the
by, was seated on the table before him, Hans having
unbuckled his helmet) but went on eating and drinking,
and chatting and laughing, in a manner ill-suited to his
dignity as champion, to say nothing of husband to the
princess.</p>

<p>The Princess Bertha was treated with the respect
due to her rank, and was pressed to partake of something,
but she refused, pleading no appetite.</p>

<p>When the host observed that the wine had got into
Hans' head, he motioned to some of the guests to engage
the princess in conversation while he administered the
drug.</p>

<p>Then, taking a paper containing a powder from his
pocket, he emptied it into a goblet of wine which he
offered to Hans.</p>

<p>But the princess, who observed this, said to the host,
"May it please your lordship to drink first this toast&mdash;'to
the prosperity of our kingdom.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The nobleman looked confused, and stammered out
that he hoped that Her Royal Highness would excuse
him, as he, a humble individual, could not think of
tasting the cup before so illustrious a guest.</p>

<p>"Then you refuse to do me this small favour, my
lord?" said Bertha.</p>

<p>But before the host had time to reply Hans had
already grasped the goblet greedily and drained it dry.
The effect was not immediate, but after about twenty
minutes Hans fell back in his chair in a state of the
most perfect insensibility.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said the host, "that your Royal
Highness's brave champion has partaken a little too
freely of the contents of my cellar. It is an accident
that is apt to befall the best of us. I am sorry for his
state, though I cannot but feel it a compliment to my
wine."</p>

<p>The princess answered not save by a look of scorn.
Then, fearing that the nobleman would offer to remove
her to another room while he procured men to remove
the helpless body of her spouse, as well as secure her
person, and bring her, in spite of herself, into her sister's
power, who was sure to make away with her secretly, she
touched herself with her wand, and instantly she became
invisible.</p>

<p>The lord searched the chamber in every corner, for
his first object was to make himself master of the person
of the princess, but failing in finding her, he next began
to unbuckle Hans' armour, and examined every plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
as he stripped him of it in his careful search for the
tiny princess. He grew more puzzled than ever at not
finding her, and ordered the other lordlings to search
the house. This they did for an hour or more without
success, when, fearing that Hans might awaken from his
trance, he ordered a litter to be brought, upon which
he securely bound our champion.</p>

<p>The helpless knight was then borne upon the
shoulders of four strong men, and carried to the common
prison, where he was fettered hand and foot,
and left in a dungeon, deep, damp and chilly, being
in a state of unconsciousness all the while. The princess,
however, though invisible, followed her husband.
If she had chosen, she could have rendered him also
invisible, and spirited him away out of harm's reach,
but she would not.</p>

<p>"No," she said to herself, "let him reap the fruits
of his folly. He will learn better by experience than by
my precepts. I will not come forward to help him until
the last."</p>

<p>Now, when Hans was left alone in his cell&mdash;that is
to say, alone save the invisible presence of his spouse&mdash;it
was already getting late. The effect of the potion
was to last for five hours, during the whole of which
time&mdash;and who knew how much longer&mdash;the princess
was doomed to breathe the damp air of a dungeon and
to wallow in the filth therein, shivering with cold; without
a fire, without her supper, and frightened to death
lest the large rats that infested the prison should make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
their supper off her or her husband; but she recollected
the wand.</p>

<p>The first thing she wanted was a light, for it was
pitch dark, not merely because it was night but because
the dungeon was underground. Feeling a stone at her
foot, she touched it with her wand, and it became a
candle, so brilliant as to light up the whole cell perfectly;
but what should she do for a fire? There was
no fireplace or stove, no place where the smoke might
escape.</p>

<p>"With this wand, I shall want for nothing," she
said, and touching the wall of the prison, that part of it
was instantly converted into a magnificent fireplace, with
a chimney and a most comfortable fire.</p>

<p>She proceeded to warm herself, but soon she felt
there lacked something. She was hungry, so she
touched the ground, and instantly there arose a little
table spread with a white tablecloth, and a little chair
just big enough for herself. Still, there was nothing on
the table as yet, save empty plates, with knives and
forks, but at that moment she noticed a great rat gnawing
her husband's toe. She hastened to drive it away,
and in doing so touched it with her wand, when it
became a roast hare.</p>

<p>Then, touching a stone, it became a loaf of bread.
A piece of bottle glass that she found on the dungeon
floor became a bottle of wine; and finding there were
no vegetables, she changed a blue-bottle fly into a dish
of spinach; a spider into some turnips, and a handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of earth from the floor into some salt, after which she
proceeded to carve.</p>

<p>Having partaken sufficiently of the first course, she
changed the remains of the hare into an apple tart, and
the vegetables into different sorts of fruit. Thus she
obtained all she required.</p>

<p>Having finished her supper, the princess waved her
wand, and the supper table, with everything on it, chair
and all, disappeared through the floor; then, seating
herself by the fire, she waited for her spouse to
awake.</p>

<p>In about three hours her worse half opened his eyes,
and stretching his gigantic limbs, gazed about him in
stupefied astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked, with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Where thou deservest to be," answered the princess,
with severity, drawing herself up to her full height.
"A pretty position, I ween, for the queen's consort&mdash;drugged
and cast into prison! Maybe that another
time thou wilt pay more attention to my words; but the
worst has not come yet. Thou art to be handed over
to the malice of my two sisters. Who knows in what
manner they may reek their vengeance? If thou
escapest with thy life, thou wilt be fortunate.</p>

<p>"Prepare, then, for thou hast brought all this on
thyself by despising my counsels. What! is a man like
thee to be at the head of the realm? <i>Thou</i>, with thy
brutish appetite, thy dense stupidity and deafness to the
voice of wisdom? A pretty example to thy subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
forsooth! Or thinkest thou that the strength of thine
arm alone will suffice to govern the kingdom? I tell
thee, brainless boor, that whatever your besotted notion
of a king may be, it is a post that is no easy task to fill,
and woe to him who aspires to the title and is not able
to discharge the duties belonging to it.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou not futurity will judge thy action,
that thy name is destined either to honour or disgrace
the page of history? That a king must not only be
brave, but wise, just, good, merciful, temperate?"</p>

<p>"Enough, O royal spouse, most august princess,"
answered Hans. "Enough for the present; but tell me
first how I came here, and next how to get out again,
and for the future I will always listen to thy counsels,
though allow me to observe that it was thy will to make
a king of me rather than mine own; therefore, if thou
hast hit upon the wrong man, methinks the blame is
thine. An I had known when I was an humble woodchopper
that to be a king I must bear this splitting headache,
lie in a dungeon full of rats, to be hanged perhaps
on the morrow, besides having to kill so many good
hearty fellows just because they happen to differ a little
in opinion from your Royal Highness, I should have
said, 'The devil take all the kings and kingdoms in the
world; I'll e'en abide here and chop wood.'"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried the princess, with asperity, "and
offend not our royal ears with such clownish sentiments.
It is but natural that thy rude nature should rebel
against counsel that is intended for thy good. It is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
be hoped, however, that with time thou mayest be
brought to a right view of the great destiny that thou
hast to fulfil.</p>

<p>"I confess that had I not been specially commanded
in a dream by the queen of the fairies to take thee and
raise thee to the throne, I should never of myself have
chosen so clownish a helpmate."</p>

<p>"Well, for the matter of that," said Hans, "dreams
are things that I don't often trouble my head about, as
I never had one come true in my life. Many is the
time I've dreamed I had my pocket full of gold, and
waking in the morning, devil a groat have I found
within it; but maybe it is not so with you princesses,
who are a different sort of grain to us poor beggars;
and perhaps fairies appear to you in dreams and tell
the truth; but whether that is or is not, I know not,
being no scholar."</p>

<p>"Well, Hans," said the princess, "thou art not far
wrong in not trusting to every dream, or in believing
there are certain privileged individuals to whom
dreams are given as a warning, as consolation, or as
prediction of good fortune; but thou oughtest no
longer to doubt, after what thou hast seen and gone
through; that thou thyself since thy nuptials hast been
under the protection of the good fairies.</p>

<p>"Has not everything gone right so long as thou
didst hearken to my voice; and did not thy good luck
desert thee solely when thou didst refuse to listen to
my warning?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, wife," said Hans, "I believe thou art about
right; d&mdash;&mdash; me if I'll ever be such a fool again."</p>

<p>"Hush, sir!" said his spouse. "No oaths in the
presence of royalty, if you please. Such language befits
not the mouth of a king."</p>

<p>"Well, well, have it thine own way," said Hans.
"I'll try to improve, only let me have a little sleep now&mdash;I
am tired."</p>

<p>"That's right, husband mine," said the princess,
seeing that her husband was more docile; "I do not
quite despair of thee yet. Thou mayest be the right
man after all. The fairies know better than I. Sleep,
and arise to-morrow a wiser man. Yet another thing
thou must bear in mind, however, thou must try to unlearn
that horrid peasant's brogue of thine. Dost hear?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that will I, royal spouse," replied Hans, in a
brogue as broad as before. Then, turning on his side,
was soon fast asleep. The princess, however, slept not
a wink that night; the excitement of the day and the
thoughts of what might possibly occur on the morrow
kept her wide awake, and thus she remained until the
morning, when she was suddenly alarmed by the sound
of footsteps, and four men entered.</p>

<p>Bertha instantly made herself invisible again. The
foremost of these men advancing, and shaking Hans
roughly out of his sleep, informed him that it was the
pleasure of the princesses that he should be brought
instantly before them. Hans started up, and would
have been violent, but his chains prevented him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the princess?" asked he, looking round
him.</p>

<p>"What princess?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"The Princess Bertha&mdash;our future queen, and my
lawful wife," replied Hans.</p>

<p>"The Princess Bertha!" exclaimed one.</p>

<p>"Your wife!" laughed another.</p>

<p>"Why, the man's mad, or else is not quite sober
yet," cried a third.</p>

<p>"Stay," said the fourth; "it is possible he has got
the dwarf princess concealed about his person. So
much the better, we shall get them both together, and
divide the reward between us. Let us search him."</p>

<p>"Ha! is that so?" said the first.</p>

<p>A rigid search was made on the person of Hans, but
they found not the princess.</p>

<p>"Hold there, ruffians!" cried Hans. "Ye shall do
the princess no harm. Do you hear; for, besides being
your rightful queen, she is my wife."</p>

<p>A general laugh ensued. Hans was no less puzzled
than the men themselves at her disappearance.</p>

<p>"Where can she be?" quoth he. "All last night
she was watching beside me, like a true wife, and
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, the fellow is dreaming still, or else trying to
befool us," cried one of the men, at length. "Let us
hasten with him to the princess."</p>

<p>Hans was then conducted into the palace, and led
into an amphitheatre, where the late king was wont to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
listen to stage plays, singing, recitations, and such
like.</p>

<p>The theatre was crowded, and in a conspicuous
place he noticed the Princess Clothilde and her sister
Carlotta.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Sir Peasant Knight. Welcome, Sir
Woodchopper," said the princesses, mockingly.</p>

<p>"We have heard of your great deeds of yesterday,
Sir Knight," said the Princess Clothilde. "Surely such
bravery deserves a reward."</p>

<p>Then, turning to one of the men who accompanied
Hans, she added: "Give the brave knight the reward
he merits."</p>

<p>The men had previously been instructed how Hans
was to be treated, so one of them proceeded to strip
him to the waist, whilst another took from behind a
column a cat-o'-nine-tails, with which he belaboured the
naked shoulders of our knight with such force that he
drew blood at every stroke, while the spectators
applauded and the princesses laughed.</p>

<p>Hans bore his flogging without wincing, though his
back was streaming with blood. The Princess Bertha
was with her husband all the while, though invisible.
She was touched at the cruel spectacle, and her blood
rose in indignation against her sisters, yet she would
not yet come forward to assist her husband. He had
been in the wrong, and he must take the consequences
of his folly. She pitied him from her heart; she
admired, too, the fortitude with which he endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
such pain and indignity; but she had his good in
view.</p>

<p>She knew that, as a child is taught to know better
another time by one good flogging, so her husband,
who was nothing but a child in mind, must be cured
by the same remedy.</p>

<p>"The loss of a little blood, as our leeches say, is
good for the health occasionally," remarked Clothilde.
"Besides, as your knighthood is well aware, a knight,
whose trade it is to shed blood, must not wince if now
and then a little of his own is shed."</p>

<p>"How thinkest thou, Sir Knight," asked Carlotta,
"that a back <i>sanglant</i> would look in thine escutcheon?"</p>

<p>These, and such like gibes were thrown at Hans,
who treated them all with silent contempt.</p>

<p>At length Bertha, observing by the countenance of
her spouse that he had had enough, thought it high
time that the tables should be turned, and the spectators
punished for their barbarity, so she whispered thus in
her husband's ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am with thee. Now that thou hast suffered the
consequences of thy disobedience, take thy revenge
upon thine enemies."</p>

<p>So saying, she touched his fetters with her wand,
and they snapped.</p>

<p>Hans needed not this prompting. Finding himself
free, his suppressed wrath having increased his natural
strength to that of a Titan, he sprang up the steps of the
amphitheatre, and seizing the throat of the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Clothilde with his right hand and that of her sister with
his left, he squeezed them with such force, that it was
a wonder both were not killed outright. However, they
certainly would have been, had not one of the lords,
whom Hans recognised as the same false lord who had
invited him to his house, and afterwards drugged him,
instantly interfered.</p>

<p>Hans left go the throats of the princesses, who fell,
to all appearances, dead, and who did not recover till
long after, and, seizing the sword of the false lord,
which he had drawn against him, he snapped it in two
across his knee, and threw the pieces into the arena.
Then, seizing the lord himself by the collar and by the
seat of his hose, he flung him with such violence over
the heads of the people, that he fell headforemost after
his sword, and his brains were dashed out.</p>

<p>Shouts of "Murder!" and "Treason!" were heard
on all sides.</p>

<p>"Seize the miscreant!"</p>

<p>The four men who had led Hans before the princesses
came forward, and would have secured him,
but Hans, brandishing in one hand a piece of his broken
chain of great weight, broke the skull of the foremost,
the back of the second, the ribs of the third, and the
shins of the fourth.</p>

<p>Some few others now attempted to seize Hans, but
there was something so terrible in his aspect as he
furiously fought his way through the crowd, knocking
down one with his fist and another with his chain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that they prudently drew back, and every spectator
took refuge in flight before the ungovernable fury of
Hans.</p>

<p>Then the Princess Bertha, making herself again
visible, ordered Hans to carry her to her two sisters,
who had just recovered consciousness. Standing upright
in the palm of her husband's hand, she addressed
them thus:</p>

<p>"Are ye not ashamed of yourselves to treat a brave
knight in this spiteful manner? Mean spirits that ye
are; but ye are rightly served. Nor is this all; there
is more in store for ye. Your ambitious scheming is
seen through, and the good powers protect the right.
Ye shall live yet to see me crowned, together with this
man, whom I now declare to be my husband. The
coronation will take place to-morrow, in spite of all
your puny schemes. Farewell!"</p>

<p>The two princesses were so enraged at the words
and bearing of their little sister whom they had persecuted,
that they knew not what to reply, but turned red
and pale by turns, stamped their feet, bit their hands,
tore their hair, and screamed.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the arch-priest," said Bertha, to her
spouse. "Go just as thou art, half-naked and bleeding.
All the world shall know how these princesses treat
brave knights."</p>

<p>So saying, the Princess Bertha left the amphitheatre
in the hand of her gigantic husband, leaving her two
envious sisters behind, foaming with rage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans hastened through the streets, his back covered
with weals and streaming with blood, towards the palace
of the arch-priest. The people recognised him as the
knight who had vanquished the champions of the twin
princesses on the day before, and asked him how he
came in such plight.</p>

<p>Then Hans, being instructed by Bertha, answered
thus:</p>

<p>"Good people, you all see in me the champion of
the Princess Bertha, who is ready to shed his last drop
of blood for her sake; and these wounds that you see
have not been inflicted in a fair fight, but by treachery.
After I vanquished the two champions of the twin
princesses several lords of the court came forward to
congratulate me on my success, and invited me into
their houses. I, contrary to the orders of our most
august princess, whom I now hold before ye (cheers
from the populace), and who, more wily than I, suspected
treachery, contrary to her orders, I trusted too
easily to false appearances, and accepted the hospitality
of one of them. He invited me to his house, gave me
to eat and to drink, and when I had well eaten and
drunk, he drugged my cup, and cast me into a dungeon
underground, where I remained all night, and was
fetched away this morning, loaded with chains, only to
be brought into the presence of the two usurping princesses
and flogged before the whole court.</p>

<p>"But it pleased the good powers to loosen my
chains, and I have given some few of them their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
deserts. Follow me, all ye that love justice, and proclaim
the right of the Princess Bertha to the crown."</p>

<p>"Long live the Princess Bertha, our rightful queen,"
cried the mob.</p>

<p>"Prince Hans, our rightful king," cried the princess.
"I here declare in the presence of all men that I am
already married to this brave knight!"</p>

<p>Tumultuous cheering ensued this speech of the
little princess, and shouts of "Long live King Hans
and Queen Bertha" followed them until they arrived
at the palace of the arch-priest. Hans knocked at the
door. The servant who opened it started back in surprise
and horror at the half-naked and bleeding figure
of the visitor.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked, rudely, as yet not
noticing the princess.</p>

<p>"I want the arch-priest. Who else did you think I
wanted," responded Hans, equally roughly.</p>

<p>"The arch-priest is not at home to everyone," said
the menial, haughtily. "What's your business?"</p>

<p>"Come, let us in immediately, and don't stand
prating there. I am the Princess Bertha," said the
dwarf princess.</p>

<p>"I crave your Royal Highness's pardon," said the
servant, bowing low. "I did not observe you," and he
allowed our pair to enter without further opposition.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" exclaimed the arch-priest who
came to meet them. "My little princess, with her
champion naked and bleeding!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Holy father," said the princess, "we wish to be
crowned to-morrow. See that preparations are made
for the occasion."</p>

<p>The arch-priest bowed to the ground.</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness's will is law. Is there no
further obstacle to the coronation?"</p>

<p>"None; and if there were, I'd conquer it as I have
done the rest. See that my spouse and I are crowned
to-morrow in presence of all the people," said the
princess.</p>

<p>"Your spouse!" exclaimed the arch-priest. "I
knew nothing of it. He is not what he seems, then&mdash;he
is of royal blood?"</p>

<p>"Royal blood or not, he is my lawful spouse, and
he is to be crowned," said the princess, firmly.</p>

<p>"But, my dear princess," answered the priest, "if
he is not of royal blood, how can I?"</p>

<p>"Enough," said Bertha. "I have the warrant of
the queen of the fairies that he is to be my partner in
life. Here is my certificate of marriage."</p>

<p>And she produced a paper five or six times as big
as herself, which she handed to the priest.</p>

<p>The priest opened it, and glanced through it.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed. "Then he really is of royal
blood. I see. What is this paper enclosed? Ha! a
pedigree." And he began to read, "Prince Hans
Wurst, son of King Blut Wurst, lost in early youth and
picked up by a woodcutter, with whom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see," said the princess, "how the fairies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
befriend me. This second paper must have been
placed here by their hands, for this is the first time I
have set eyes upon it. Are you content with the information
therein contained?" asked the Princess Bertha.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, your Royal Highness," said the arch-priest,
bowing.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then, it must take place, father," said
the princess.</p>

<p>"Without delay," replied the priest. "But, tell me,
what on earth brings His Royal Highness Prince Hans
here in this pitiable plight?"</p>

<p>Bertha then began to recount the misadventures of
her knight and the spite of her envious sisters, the
detailing of which filled the poor old priest with
horror.</p>

<p>"But, at any rate," said he, at the conclusion of the
narrative, "let the prince's wounds be healed. Send
for a surgeon."</p>

<p>"A surgeon! Bah!" cried the princess. "Behold,
sir priest, what one favoured by the fairies can do," and
thus saying, she touched her husband's back with her
wand, and it instantly healed so that none could see
even the slightest scratch.</p>

<p>"Gramercy!" quoth the arch-priest; "I never
before beheld such a miracle. Thou art indeed
favoured of the higher powers."</p>

<p>"Does that surprise thee, holy father? Behold
another wonder," said Bertha, and she touched the back
of Hans a second time with her wand, and instantly her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
semi-nude champion was covered from head to foot in
an elegant royal dress, composed of a crimson velvet
tunic, half-way to the knee, and trimmed with ermine,
and silken hose of a buff colour.</p>

<p>A gold-hilted sword, in the form of a cross, hung by
his side, within a bejewelled scabbard, likewise a dagger.
A chain of massive gold about his neck, and a graceful
barrette, with a white ostrich feather, which was fastened
by a huge diamond. The arch-priest started back
several paces, rubbed his eyes, and, looking first at the
princess and then at Hans, and then at the princess
again, he took her in his hand, and whispered in her
ear that he hoped it was not witchcraft, and being
assured by Bertha that it was not, he smiled, and
congratulated Prince Hans on his improved appearance.</p>

<p>Hans, suddenly discovering that he had undergone
a change, called for a mirror, and was shown into
another chamber, where there stood one large enough
for him to look at himself at full length. Our prince
began to admire himself, and to cut all sorts of capers,
at which the arch-priest laughed heartily; but Bertha
reproved her spouse for his levity, and told him such
antics did not become a king.</p>

<p>The prince immediately ceased his tricks, and taking
leave of the arch-priest respectfully, left his palace with
his little wife in the breast of his tunic.</p>

<p>As he opened the palace door, he saw standing at
the gate his own charger, gaily bedizened. The animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
had been sent to await him at the arch-priest's palace
by the fairies. Hans mounted, and proceeded to show
himself to everyone through the streets of the city,
while the crowd shouted, "Long live King Hans and
Queen Bertha!"</p>

<p>Now, Bertha knew her twin sisters too well not to
suspect them of treachery up to the very last.</p>

<p>"It is certain," said she to herself, "that they have
sent spies after us. They will not rest until Hans, at
least, is killed."</p>

<p>Looking round in the crowd, she spied a man
whose face pleased her not, and who glanced furtively
at Hans. She observed, too, that he carried a long
rope with a slip-knot over his arm. Her natural
penetration told her that danger would proceed from
that quarter, so, touching her husband's neck with her
wand, she said:</p>

<p>"Be as hard as iron and as immovable as a rock."</p>

<p>They rode on together till they came to a large
square, when suddenly the man with the rope, watching
his opportunity, threw the cord over the heads of the
people, so that the slip-knot fixed itself round the throat
of Hans, and the man pulled with all his might and main
to throttle him and to drag him from his seat; but instead
of accomplishing his object, the rope did no more
harm to Han's neck than had it been the trunk of a
tree, while the horse and his rider proceeded as before,
dragging the man behind after them; nor could he
leave go the rope, for the princess had wrought a charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
on him, and thus he was dragged through the city in the
sight of all men, hooted and pelted by the crowd as he
was dragged along.</p>

<p>As for Hans, he felt the rope no more than had it
been a spider's web. The report of the strength of
Han's neck spread throughout all the land, and all
declared that that alone was sufficient to qualify him for
the crown, accordingly, on the following day great
preparations were already made for the coronation,
which was to take place in the cathedral of the town.</p>

<p>The doors of the church were crammed with the
equipages of all the lords and ladies in the land,
amongst which were the carriages of the Princesses
Clothilde and Carlotta, who had arrived, each with an
escort of armed men, to prevent the coronation of their
sister, but the mob was so violently in favour of the
Princess Bertha, that the escorts were beaten back.
The little princess, however, gave orders that her
sisters were to be admitted, so the twin princesses took
their seats to witness the ceremony.</p>

<p>Now, a man had been bribed by them to be close to
the person of the prince all the time, and the moment
the crown was being placed upon his head to stab him
in the back; but Bertha, still suspicious of treachery,
looked around her and saw the man, who was just in
the act of assassinating her husband, when, waving her
wand in time, she converted his dagger into a venomous
serpent, which twisted itself round his body, and bit
him that he died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Great was the uproar and surprise at this scene,
and the crowd were ready to tear the twin princesses to
pieces; but the arch-priest commanded them to forbear,
and the ceremony proceeded without opposition.</p>

<p>Suddenly a soft music was heard throughout the
cathedral, and a perfume as of incense arose. Then a
sunbeam from one of the upper windows in the church
revealed an innumerable multitude of little fairies, two
of which carried a little crown between them, just big
enough for the head of the pigmy queen.</p>

<p>The multitude was struck with awe and the two
sisters filled with fury at the sight; but the ceremony
passed off quietly. Nevertheless, the twin princesses,
dreading the mob, stepped hastily into their respective
carriages, and drove back to the palace.</p>

<p>When King Hans and Queen Bertha drove off in
their carriage, which, by the way, was made by the
fairies themselves for the occasion, the mob was half-blinded
by the brilliancy of the jewels with which it
was inlaid, and our new sovereigns were cheered by the
crowd till they arrived at the palace door.</p>

<p>Now, the two princesses, instead of yielding up the
palace to the rightful owners, had ordered the door to
be barricaded and entrance refused to the royal pair,
which, when Bertha discovered, she immediately waved
her wand in front of the palace, and changed it into a
prison filled with gloomy cells, and the gay clothes of
the people within into the squalid garments of prisoners,
while the golden bracelets of the princesses became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
manacles for their wrists, and their garters fetters for
their feet.</p>

<p>Then, waving her wand in the direction of the
prison in which her husband had been confined, which
stood not far off, it became a magnificent palace, equal,
if not superior, in grandeur to that which she erected upon
the ruins of the wizard's castle, so that all wondered,
and shouted, "Welcome to Queen Bertha, and down
with the twin princesses!"</p>

<p>The man who had attempted the life of Prince Hans
with his lasso on the day before was publicly hanged
with his own rope on the roof of the prison where the
two princesses now languished as an example to all
rebels.</p>

<p>After the wicked princesses had been imprisoned for
a week the tiny queen released them on condition that
they should flee the country and not show their faces
again. The sisters heard their sentence in sullen
silence, and quitted the country shortly afterwards,
amid the curses of the crowd, and established themselves
in a foreign land, where, out of spite, they gave
themselves over to witchcraft, and leagued with the
queen of the witches, who was also exiled there, to
work all sorts of spells upon their sister from afar; but
they all failed, as the pigmy queen was too powerfully
protected by the fairies.</p>

<p>King Hans grew in wisdom every day under the
sage counsel of his spouse, till at length his subjects
bestowed on him the name of "The wisest and the
bravest king living."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>In proportion as Hans' intelligence and good
manners improved, grew the love of Bertha for her
husband. They soon knew how to appreciate and
respect each other, till at length there was not a more
loving couple in the whole world.</p>

<p>About a year after King Hans and Queen Bertha
had ascended the throne a war broke out between his
and a neighbouring country. The latter was the same
land where the wicked princesses had fled into exile,
and this was to be the seat of war.</p>

<p>One day, as the queen was seated in the boudoir of
the palace in a pensive attitude, while her husband was
putting on his armour, previous to departing for the
war, she was startled by a sound of chattering, screeching,
and the fluttering of wings. As she was about to
ring the bell for the servant to inquire the meaning of
this strange noise the door opened, and an ape and
crow entered, followed by a large spider, which, making
towards the queen and bowing low, cried out, "A boon,
a boon! O gracious queen, according to thy promise."</p>

<p>And immediately the little queen recognised the ape
that had escaped with her from the hands of the showman
and carried her to the top of a tree, the crow that
had carried her down again and left her on the banks of
a stream, and the spider that had saved her life by
catching her in its web and carrying her safely to the
bottom of the precipice, when her cruel sister Clothilde
thought to rid herself for ever of her rival by precipitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
her into the lake below. She remembered that
she had promised a boon to all three when she came to
be queen.</p>

<p>"A boon, a boon!" chattered the monkey.</p>

<p>"A boon, a boon!" screeched the crow.</p>

<p>"A boon, a boon!" whispered the spider, whose
voice was less strong than the other two, being an
insect.</p>

<p>"What boon do ye ask?" demanded her majesty.</p>

<p>"Change us to our proper forms again!" cried all at
once. "We have heard that thou possessest a fairy
wand. Disenchant us, O queen, and give us back our
natural forms."</p>

<p>Queen Bertha then waving her wand over the head
of each, they suddenly resumed their respective shapes.
The ape and the spider became two handsome youths,
while the crow took the form of a comely and dignified
matron in the habiliments of a queen. Each of the
two youths recognised the other, though after a lapse of
many years, as his lost brother, and rushed into each
other's arms.</p>

<p>The venerable lady who had hitherto figured as a
crow, but who was neither more nor less than a queen
herself, recognised in these two youths her long lost
sons, and they, in their turn, recognised the late crow
as their mother, and fell upon her neck and kissed her.
The old queen wept for joy, and knew not how to thank
Bertha for what she had done.</p>

<p>"O favoured of the fairies!" pleaded the mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the two princes, "think me not bold if I further trespass
on thy benevolence and crave another boon."</p>

<p>"Ask, and it is granted," quoth the smaller queen.</p>

<p>"I have yet another son and I know not what has
become of him&mdash;my eldest boy&mdash;also three daughters,
whom the queen witch has metamorphosed into a bat,
a toad, and an owl. Let me set eyes again on my
eldest son, if he, indeed, be living, and, prithee, O
gracious queen, disenchant my daughters."</p>

<p>"It shall be done," responded the pigmy queen, and
waving her wand, there immediately flew through the
window, which was open, an owl and a bat, the owl
bearing in its beak a toad by the leg, which it immediately
dropped on entering the royal boudoir, and the
three stood in a row before Bertha.</p>

<p>"Obnoxious beings," said the pigmy queen, "resume
your respective forms."</p>

<p>So saying, she waved her wand over each, and they
were suddenly converted into three beautiful maidens,
who immediately recognising their mother and their two
brothers, fell into their arms and devoured them with
kisses.</p>

<p>At the same moment that the three unsightly objects
made their appearance at the window the door opened,
and in walked&mdash;who? Hans, clad in complete armour,
and the old queen recognised her lost eldest son.
Hans remained stupefied at the group before him;
then, when everything was explained, he wept upon his
mother's neck, and embraced his brothers and sisters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hans had little time to lose; his army was
about to march, so taking a hasty farewell of his
relatives, he placed his diminutive spouse within his
helmet, as was his wont, and mounted his charger.
His two younger brothers, Otto and Oscar, were
determined to follow him to battle, so Queen Bertha
changed two black pigs that had strayed into the palace
garden, and were uprooting the plants, into two fiery
war horses, nobly caparisoned, and the three brothers
started for the war, while their mother and three sisters
waved their handkerchiefs after them until they were
out of sight, and uttered prayers for their safe return.</p>

<p>Now, this war had been brought about by the evil
spells of the queen witch and Bertha's two malicious
sisters, who, wishing to avenge themselves on their
pigmy sister, caused the monarch in whose country
they lived to pick a quarrel with King Hans, which
should lead to a war, by which they hoped to be the
gainers. But Hans and Bertha were in favour with the
good fairies, and the luck was, as usual, on their side.</p>

<p>The foreign monarch's city was besieged, and many
put to the sword. The king himself, together with the
witch queen and the two wicked sisters were taken
prisoners. The witch queen was burnt alive publicly,
as a punishment for her many sins, and the twin sisters
imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>Queen Bertha was naturally of a benevolent disposition,
and would have pardoned her sisters, but her
prudence conquered this feeling, and she deemed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
expedient to put it out of their power to do harm to
anyone by shutting them up in prison, where, after
languishing for some years, they died still impenitent.</p>

<p>After the death of the witch queen the spell which
she had wrought upon Bertha while yet unborn was
broken, and the pigmy queen took suddenly to growing,
and increased each day six inches in height, till she
reached the stature of an ordinary full-grown woman.</p>

<p>She preserved her surpassing beauty till her death,
and lived to bless her husband with a family of twelve
children.</p>

<p>Hans' two brothers returned unhurt from battle, and
lived with their mother and sisters in the splendid
palace that Bertha had raised on the spot where had
stood the wizard's castle.</p>

<p>King Hans lived to a good old age, and died a good
man and wise monarch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be in vain to describe the enthusiasm that
prevailed as Helen concluded her fairy tale. Any story
that partook at all of the marvellous was sure to meet
with thorough appreciation, whoever might be the
teller; but when the sunny dreams of fairyland were
shaped into words by lips so rosy as those of our host's
daughter, Methuselah himself might have felt his blood
boil in his veins.</p>

<p>All the old fogies of the club felt their youth
suddenly restored to them, and it was all they could do
to keep themselves from falling prostrate at the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the fair story-teller. As for our artist, he had lost his
heart long ago. Here was a pretty to do! As for
Helen, I'm afraid that she had caught the complaint.
What was to be done? Well, never mind at present;
perhaps the dart may not have struck very deep.</p>

<p>But here comes our host, who, roused by the
boisterous cheering of the guests, has come to call away
his daughter to her meal. And high time, too, unless
he wishes all their heads to be turned by this bewitching
enchantress.</p>

<p>The eulogiums on Helen's beauty, manners, and
powers for story-telling lasted until dinner time, and
such an impression had her story and manner of telling
it made upon all, that no one felt inclined either to
relate or listen to another, and the club actually retired
to rest that evening without a story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>The Haunted Stage Box.&mdash;The Tragedian's Story.</h3>

<p>The following morning was bright, clear, and frosty.
At an early hour two of our guests were to leave the
"Headless Lady" by the mail for London. These two
were Captain Toughyarn and our comic friend, Mr.
Jollytoast. Each had urgent business on hand, and the
other members of the club had risen to see them off.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been laid for these two worthies;
their companions seated themselves at the same table,
and chatted with them whilst waiting for the stage-coach.</p>

<p>"Well, captain," said Mr. Oldstone, "after you
return from your next voyage, you'll visit us again and
have another dream over our punch like that last one of
yours, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, messmate," replied the captain; "you may
be sure of that. That is to say, if we are all still in the
land of the living. I'd come, even if I had no other
inducement than the bright eyes of our host's pretty
daughter."</p>

<p>"Avast there! captain," said Mr. Jollytoast.
"Remember the mermaid! Think of Lurline! Take
care, lest Helen should prove even more dangerous."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the horn of the stage-coach was heard in
the distance, and in a short time the horses were at the
door. Our two travellers took their seats, after having
been repeatedly invited to return, and some jovial sallies
having passed between our host and the driver over a
stiff glass of grog, the coach started, and was soon out
of sight. After their two friends had departed the rest
of the club set out together for an hour's stroll before
breakfast, to enjoy the fresh morning air, walking all of
them abreast, and taking up all the carriage road.</p>

<p>The way was long and lonely&mdash;not a soul stirring,
and the landscape as far as they could see covered with
snow; but the sky was cheerful, and the little birds
sang overhead. Our club felt exhilarated by the nipping
air, and discoursed by the way on divers subjects,
until Mr. Oldstone, whose appetite for stories was insatiable,
said that he saw no reason why Mr. Blackdeed's
story that was to come next should not enliven their
walk. The proposal was seconded, and Mr. Blackdeed,
finding himself loudly called upon, began his story
thus:</p>

<p>I must begin, then, gentlemen, by informing you
that my family name is not the one I bear at present.
It is many years since I dropped that. My father was
of good family, and possessed a large estate in &mdash;&mdash;shire.
I was an only son, and should have inherited
my father's estate, had not a rascally uncle of mine
cheated me out of it.</p>

<p>I was looked upon as a lad of great promise by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
fond parents, and from earliest youth seemed destined
for the stage; for as far back as I can remember my
greatest delight was to see a pantomime. I was more
precocious than the general run of children at my age,
for at an age when few children have begun to read I
was already manager of a toy theatre. This taste of
mine grew with my growth, and was encouraged by my
parents&mdash;probably because they saw it was an innocent
amusement and kept me out of mischief.</p>

<p>At ten years old I began to write plays, in which I
used to act myself and invite my schoolfellows to act
with me. This rendered me very popular at school,
both with the boys and with the masters, and I won
many a prize for public speaking and for learning by
heart long passages from Shakespeare and other
poets.</p>

<p>At fourteen I grew ambitious, and published a book
of plays under my own name, which, unluckily, was cut
up unmercifully by the critics. This was mortifying
enough, but added to this I had to bear my father's displeasure
for having published the book under his name,
my parent believing it a great disgrace for a son of his
to write books or plays. So he gave me a severe reprimand,
and from that time forth thought it his duty to
discourage my taste for the drama. But nature will
have her own way, in spite of whatever obstacles parents,
and friends place in her path, and at fifteen I yearned
for the mysteries of the "green room."</p>

<p>I had secretly, but no less determinedly, set my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
heart on following the stage as a profession, and one
day my father took me into his study, and said it was
high time I should make up my mind what profession
to follow. I replied that I had made up my mind
already what profession to follow. I told him that I
intended to be an actor. At this he told me to get
such ideas out of my head as soon as possible, that he
would never allow a son of his to disgrace his name by
associating it with the stage.</p>

<p>I repeated my determination. He grew furious, and
after beating me, locked me up in my room and
ordered bread and water to be brought to me by a
servant. This treatment, he told me, was to last until
I had come to my senses. However well this mode of
proceeding might have answered with a youth of less
spirit, it did not answer with me. Even an ordinary
boy of fifteen is no child, and I at that age was equal
to a man of twenty.</p>

<p>I felt the indignity of this treatment as an excessively
sensitive organisation would. I refused to touch
either the bread or the water, and meditated an escape
from the paternal roof, never to return.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that at that time there was in the
village a band of strolling players, who had hired a barn
to act in. These I had been in the habit of seeing act
every evening, till my passion for the stage was augmented
to an intense degree.</p>

<p>The players were to leave on the morrow. Here
was an opportunity! I would wait till the evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
escape by the window of my chamber, and offer my
services to the manager. I looked down from my
window into the garden, to ascertain if I could venture
upon a leap; but it was much too high for me, yet
there was a ladder against the wall, though not near
enough for me to reach.</p>

<p>What was I to do? I tied sundry pocket-handkerchiefs
together, which I wetted. I then tied an ornament
that served as a paper weight, being rather heavy,
and holding one end of the wet handkerchief in my
hand, I threw the heavy end towards the ladder, which
it caught, winding itself round one of the rungs so
tightly that I was enabled to draw it towards me and
place it just under my window, ready for the evening.</p>

<p>The evening came. I waited till my parents were
at supper. This was just about the time that the
evening's performance would be at an end. I donned
my worst clothes, and tying up some necessaries in a
handkerchief and taking a walking-stick to carry the
bundle across my shoulder, I opened my casement and
cautiously descended the ladder till I found myself in
the garden.</p>

<p>There was yet another obstacle to be overcome; the
garden wall had to be scaled, for the gate was already
locked. The wall was high, but after much exertion
and many falls, I scrambled up&mdash;I hardly know how&mdash;and
leapt down the other side into the road. I found
that I had ripped up my coat behind and damaged the
knees of my small clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>In this plight I made my appearance before the
manager. He looked at me from head to foot, scrutinisingly;
asked me my name and what I had been bred
up to. I gave him the name I bear at present, and
said that I had never been brought up to any trade, but
had always had a taste for the stage.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he muttered, observing that I spoke
better English than himself or his company, "you
appear a youth of some little education&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I trust that will not unfit me for your company?"
I said.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, young man," he said, "we are in
want of educated actors; but what brings you in this
pitiful plight?"</p>

<p>"The frowns of fortune," I observed, laconically.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he observed, with a smile; "I understand.
Well, what can you do?"</p>

<p>"My <i>forte</i>," I replied, "is high tragedy."</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare say," said he, satirically, "and I've no
doubt you'll tell me that Macbeth, Hamlet, and Othello
are your chief characters."</p>

<p>"Precisely so," I replied; "that is just what I mean
to say."</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said. "My dear young man,
you're stage-struck like many others at your age. All
you youngsters, when you begin, fancy that you are
going to leap over the heads of us old experienced
actors with a bound; but in everything you must
begin at the beginning, and you will have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
serve your apprenticeship at acting as well as anything
else."</p>

<p>"Serve my apprenticeship!" I muttered to myself,
indignantly. "<i>I</i>, the son of a gentleman, serve an
apprenticeship!"</p>

<p>But I held my peace, as it did not suit me to
quarrel with the manager at the onset.</p>

<p>"You must content yourself at present with small
parts," said the manager, "such as a page or walking
gentleman, or, being yet very youthful looking, you
might take a female part."</p>

<p>The latter part of the manager's speech offended my
dignity, but I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Come," said he, "let me see what you can do.
Give me your idea of Hamlet. Begin with, 'To be, or
not to be.'"</p>

<p>I accordingly began at the well-known passage, and
recited it all the way through.</p>

<p>"Not so bad, by jingo!" said he. "Bravo! I did
not think you were such a clever fellow. Now do the
dagger scene in Macbeth."</p>

<p>I then went through that with equal success, and
received very high praise from the manager, who
engaged me on the spot. I gave out a hint that I had
eaten nothing all day, and was very hungry, so the
manager invited me to supper. I made the acquaintance
of all the other strolling players&mdash;a queer lot&mdash;who
looked at me askance, doubtless because they saw
I came of a rather better stock than they themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and probably they speculated on what they could make
out of me.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we all started for London,
and my <i>debut</i> was made in a low London theatre,
where I took the part of a young lady carried away by
brigands. In the next piece I acted a page, in the next
a lover, and so on. But I soon grew discontented with
this small theatre, for I longed to show myself to the
educated public, so I left my first manager, and sought
an engagement in some more fashionable theatre.</p>

<p>Here I had to act a fairy prince in a pantomime.
The pantomime was a great success, and drew many
spectators. At the same time that the pantomime was
going on, I had to act a page in one of Shakespeare's
plays. I was now seventeen, and both tall and well
grown, and possessed at that time&mdash;I think I can afford
to say so now, gentlemen, as I am verging at present
towards "the sear and yellow leaf"&mdash;a figure and a face
that were the envy of the whole company.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, I improved fast in my profession,
and one evening when the play of Romeo and Juliet
was being acted at the theatre, the actor who should
have taken the part of Romeo was indisposed only a
few minutes before the curtain drew up. There was no
one else in the company but myself who was sufficiently
up in the part to take his place, so I offered my services,
and they were accepted.</p>

<p>Now, Romeo was one of my favourite characters,
and I had studied the part carefully; but the manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
knew nothing of my talents as yet; in fact, he confessed
to me afterwards that he was very doubtful as to
the success of the piece that evening.</p>

<p>When the curtain drew up and the piece proceeded,
I fancied I noticed signs of discontent among the audience
at not finding the usual Romeo, but as I went on
with my part the applause was so great that I felt as if
my reputation were established for life. In fact, I completely
eclipsed the actor whose part I had taken,
inasmuch that the public refused to hear him again in
that part, and the manager allotted his part to me.</p>

<p>This led to great jealousy between us. We
quarrelled, and I made this the excuse for leaving the
theatre, being anxious to appear in a still more fashionable
one. I sought an engagement in one of the
largest theatres in the metropolis, and as I already had
some fame, I was engaged at once. The manager had
seen me perform himself, and promised me when
Romeo and Juliet should be acted again in his theatre
that he would give me the part of Romeo. They
happened to be acting Hamlet then; and the part of
Laertes was allotted to me. I acquitted myself with
much <i>eclat</i>, and a long and favourable criticism
appeared in the papers afterwards.</p>

<p>One evening I took the part of Hamlet, the usual
actor not being able to perform, and acquitted myself
so well that the papers were full of the wonderful young
actor. From this time my name began to be famous.
I received a good salary, dressed fashionably, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
entered into the best society. Nevertheless, I was
aware of the prejudice that the world has against an
actor, however celebrated he may be, so whenever I
went into society, I dropped the name of Blackdeed,
and resumed my own rightful one. Many, however, on
being introduced to me remarked how much I resembled
the celebrated young actor Blackdeed; but it
was not for some time afterwards that it was generally
known that we were one and the same person.</p>

<p>One evening, as I was entering a ball-room, I
noticed that when my name was announced some confusion
took place. As I entered, who should come
forward to meet me but my father, whom I had not
seen for three years. He advanced towards me, more
in sorrow than in anger, and addressed me in tones in
which pride and natural affection strove for the mastery.</p>

<p>"We meet at last, sir," he said; "I leave it to your
conscience to imagine the state of anxiety into which
you have thrown your poor mother and myself by your
cruel conduct. I would fain have overlooked the
whole as a boyish freak, had you returned home of your
own accord and sought my pardon; as it is, what can
I say to you for having disgraced my name?"</p>

<p>"Disgraced your name, father! How?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; disgraced my name, by associating it
with the stage&mdash;a name untainted and highly honoured
for many generations back."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," I said, "I never yet heard that talent or
genius could disgrace a name. However, aware of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
prejudice against the stage, I have dropped your name,
which might otherwise have become famous, and act
under a fictitious one."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said he, somewhat pacified that his
name had escaped disgrace. "And what may be your
theatrical name?"</p>

<p>"Blackdeed," said I.</p>

<p>"What! So you are the celebrated young actor
everyone talks so much about," said he. "Well, well,
you have been very foolish and very wrong, but if you
consent to leave this life and return home with me, all
may yet be well. Come," he said coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Father," I said, "my course is mapped out. I
have chosen my profession, and I must follow my true
avocation. The voice of nature is stronger than yours.
Seek not to battle against my destiny."</p>

<p>My father, though immensely disappointed at my
determination, would not, I believe, have cut me off,
but dying suddenly, intestate, his estate was seized by
his brother. This led to a law-suit between my uncle
and myself, which lasted until nearly all my father's
fortune was squandered away. I never got a farthing.
Thus ever since I have had nothing to depend upon
but my profession for a livelihood.</p>

<p>It now began to be rumoured abroad in society that
I was none other than that very Blackdeed whose
acting had created such a <i>furore</i> in the world. It also
began to be said that I was the heir to an immense
fortune, out of which I had been swindled by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
unprincipled uncle. I met those who knew my family
well, and my misfortune procured for me the sympathy
of many. I possessed a still greater interest in the eyes
of the world now, and I found myself a greater lion
than ever.</p>

<p>On one occasion after I had been acting Romeo at
our theatre I donned my dress clothes and dropped in
late at a friend's house where there was a ball, and here
I made the acquaintance of a certain family who resided
not far from my father's house and knew my father
intimately. The family consisted of an elderly
gentleman, his wife, and three daughters.</p>

<p>The two elder sisters were very ordinary young
ladies, such as one is sure to find in every ball-room.
They were neither pretty nor ugly; their manners conventional,
their conversation flat and insipid. When
talking to one they appeared to be thinking of something
else, and their answers were generally in monosyllables.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter, however, differed much
from her two eldest sisters, both in mind and in
features; so much so, indeed, that I imagined for some
time that she must be their step-sister, but this was not
the case, as I found out afterwards. Maud&mdash;that was
the name of the younger&mdash;was by far the cleverest
really of the whole family, and yet she was looked upon
as a ninny by the rest. She had more originality in her
than either of her two sisters, as I soon observed from
her remarks; but she was also more retired, and preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to hide her light, as it were, under a bushel. It
was only now and then that I could catch a glimpse of
it, but when I did so it was most brilliant.</p>

<p>Without being strikingly beautiful, her face had that
in it that captivates more than mere beauty. The
expression was ingenuous and pensive, at times melancholy.
When in society she never seemed like one of
the herd, or to take the slightest interest in what was
going on. She went through her dancing mechanically,
and always seemed in the clouds, or, as her sisters would
say, "wool-gathering."</p>

<p>It was easy to see from the first that no very sister-like
feeling existed between the two elder sisters and
their younger one. Even the parents preferred their
two elder girls to their youngest daughter.</p>

<p>The fact was that they&mdash;none of them&mdash;understood
her; she was not of their order, and they set her down
as rather wanting. If she was scolded for anything and
she bore the rebuke with patience, this was set down to
indifference and want of feeling, when my own experience
of her character was that she was the most sensitive
creature that I had ever met with. If, as was often
the case, she fell into a reverie in company, it was
called sulkiness, and if when asked to perform on the
piano, she meekly obeyed in a sort of languid manner
peculiar to herself, it was called unwillingness to oblige;
yet when at the instrument her touch was so soft and
full of feeling, her voice so clear and modulating, that
it seemed as if her whole soul was poured forth in the
piece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, neither her parents nor her sisters
appreciated her playing, or found in it anything more
artistic or soul-stirring than in the performance of other
people. She was never thanked or applauded by her
family for any service or kindness of hers towards them,
but often upbraided for selfishness when her dreamy
nature would cause her to forget the wants of others,
while in reality she was one of the most unselfish beings
on this earth. How many mistakes might be rectified,
if the different members of a family would take the
trouble to study each other more accurately!</p>

<p>Maud's nature was reserved to a fault; she did not
care to shine, and this was put down to incapacity.
Whether it was she felt she could if she chose, and in
so doing utterly eclipse her two elder sisters, and consequently
incur their envy, or whether it was an excess
of modesty, I know not. One thing is certain, she
possessed fine talents, and those, too, of an uncommon
kind. Her health was delicate, and her parents, perhaps
attributed her peculiarities to the state of her
health, while her two sisters, without allowing any such
excuse, looked upon her as a downright fool.</p>

<p>She was snubbed on every occasion, and kept as
much as possible in the background. It will be understood
that all these observations of mine were not made
in a single evening. It was not until we grew intimate
and I had been repeatedly invited to the house, that I
found out how matters stood in the family. I could
not help feeling nettled at the deliberate way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
poor Maud was put on the shelf by her elder sisters,
and I felt it my duty, as much as good manners would
permit me, to take her part, and pay somewhat more
attention to her than to the two elder daughters.</p>

<p>This preference I saw was observed, and not looked
upon very favourably by the parents, who, I began to
find out, had marked me for one of the elder girls. I
saw plainly through their schemes, and heartlessly
amused myself at their discomfiture while I paid my
attentions to Maud. During the summer I was invited
to stay at the country seat of this family, and it was here
that our intimacy ripened. Here I observed the fine
points of Maud's character, in spite of all her reserve.</p>

<p>Without being regularly in love with each other, a
sympathy had grown up between us which by others, I
have no doubt, was regarded as love. We appreciated
each other's talents, and esteemed each other's
characters.</p>

<p>The family had repeatedly seen me act, and Maud,
more than any of them, seemed to appreciate my acting,
while I was equally charmed at her skill on the piano
and on the harp, and with her singing.</p>

<p>"I do not know how it is, Mr. Blackdeed," she said
to me one day when we were left alone together in the
garden, "but you are the only person I know who treats
me with respect, or, indeed, like a rational being."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said I, feigning not to have observed the
way in which she was treated by her family. "How
so?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! you know very well how I am treated at
home. I have seen the surprise on your face whenever
my sisters snubbed me, and saw that you felt how unfair
it was. You will not pretend that you never
observed it."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Maud," I replied, "your penetration is
such that I cannot do other than confess that <i>I have</i>
observed it, and that I was very much surprised at it. I
have often wondered what the reason could be."</p>

<p>She answered with a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"No one seems to understand me. From childhood
I was ever different from the rest. I seem to live two
distinct beings&mdash;one with my family, and before the
world, and another in my own thoughts.</p>

<p>"You will have observed my silence when in company.
I am aware to what it is generally attributed;
but the fact is, that I have so little in common with my
sisters I feel that if I were to give utterance to my ideas
I should not be understood, but be considered more
mad than they think me at present; hence my silence.
I never knew anyone but you who thought even in the
slightest degree like myself, and therefore to you I feel
less inclined to be reserved than to others; in fact, with
you I feel it impossible to be reserved at all.</p>

<p>"It is as if you had some power over me to draw
out my ideas&mdash;to draw me out of myself. All my life I
have longed to know someone; to have some friend
who was unlike the rest of the world, and more like
myself, who could understand me, and to whom I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
pour out my thoughts, and feel that they were not
poured out upon a desert soil."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Maud," said I, "that from the
very first I saw that you were quite different to any other
young lady that I had ever met with? But far from
regarding you in the light that I know your family
regard you, I conceived an immense respect for you as
a being of a higher order than the generality of young
ladies. There was much, too, that puzzled me in your
character. I was convinced that you could not but be
aware that your abilities were above the ordinary, and it
surprised me much that you should care so little about
showing them, or even asserting your right against the&mdash;the
tyranny, if I may say so&mdash;of your sisters."</p>

<p>"Well, it is my nature," she said. "What is it to
me if they <i>do</i> have their own way in everything. I do
not think it a matter worth disputing about. I do not
live in their world, nor they in mine."</p>

<p>"And do you not long to make yourself better
understood to your sisters?" I asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"I should like to," she replied; "but that is impossible."</p>

<p>"Why impossible?" I asked. "Have you ever
tried to do so?"</p>

<p>"No; but from my knowledge of their characters it
would be useless." She paused, and then added, "Do
you know that I sometimes wish that I were better
suited to this world than I am? My nature is so very
peculiar that perhaps you would laugh at me were I to
tell you some of my peculiarities."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said I; "I do not think I should laugh at
any peculiarities of your nature, whatever they might
be. Your nature is one to study gravely and reflect
upon, not to laugh at."</p>

<p>"I mean," said she, "that my temperament is subject
to certain phenomena that many, perhaps <i>you</i>,
might call hallucinations. I have never confided this
to anyone before, fearing that I should be ridiculed or
perhaps placed under the hands of some ignorant
doctor."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "I am curious to
hear of what sort these phenomena are. I take an
immense interest in natural phenomena, especially
that sort connected with the temperament of
individuals."</p>

<p>"Well," she answered, "as you encourage me so
far, I do not mind telling you some of those most
common to me. Ofttimes when I am alone, either in
my chamber or walking in the fields, a sort of dizziness
comes over me, and I seem to be in the midst of a bed
of flowers. When I try to pluck one they instantly
vanish, and the dizziness likewise disappears. At other
times I have seen before me a wreath of stars, which
lasts for two or three minutes, then also vanishes. I
have seen, too, distinctly in the daytime the faces of
certain relations of mine, long since dead, and at night
I occasionally start out of my sleep and see human
forms bending over me, and sometimes they speak
to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very strange," I observed. "And have you
never been able to attribute these visions to any nervous
excitement, or to any natural cause whatever?"</p>

<p>"No; on the contrary, they generally appear when
I am most calm."</p>

<p>I told her I had heard before of similar phenomena
during, or even a long time after, a serious illness, and
that I thought in most cases they might be attributed
to an over-excitement of the brain, brought on by indigestion
or other causes. She told me that she had
never had any really serious illness in her life, though
she admitted that she was constitutionally delicate.
We then went into a metaphysical discussion, which
was interrupted by the rest of the family, who came to
meet us in the garden.</p>

<p>"I am sorry we have disturbed your <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,"
said one of the elder sisters, quizzingly. "It must have
been quite a pleasure to have been concealed behind
the summer-house and listened to your intellectual conversation."</p>

<p>These words to a stranger would have conveyed
nothing but a sort of merry banter, nor was there more
conveyed in the tone, yet I, who had studied the nature
of the speaker well, thought I discovered an undercurrent
of sarcasm in the word "intellectual," as if she
was perfectly sure that no conversation between us
could be intellectual.</p>

<p>"There is many a true word spoken in jest," I
replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
"I assure you that our conversation <i>has</i> been <i>most</i>
intellectual. Miss Maud's ideas are so lofty, that it is
really quite an effort on my part to follow her," said I,
with a smile, though I really meant what I said.</p>

<p>"I wish she would let us have the benefit of them,"
said the other sister, laughing, imagining, of course,
that I had spoken satirically. "She never favours us
with any of those lofty ideas."</p>

<p>"No?" said I, affecting astonishment. "Then I
must be a favoured individual. Miss Maud's case is,
however, not without parallel. Many of our greatest
minds have been most reserved and unassuming. It is
a characteristic of genius to be retired, though, if I had
the abilities of Miss Maud, I am sure I should be too
vain to keep them secret."</p>

<p>This was uttered with a sincerity of manner on my
part that checked the laugh that might have arisen from
the sisters, and they were silent. The mother looked
at us both, first at one and then at the other, in amazement,
as if she half-believed me, and scrutinised Maud
very narrowly, as if she fancied she must either be a
great fool or very deep.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon the lady of the house
took me aside and asked me if I were in earnest in my
eulogium of Maud's intellect.</p>

<p>I replied that I was decidedly.</p>

<p>"What a strange girl it is!" she exclaimed. "She
never seems to take any interest in anything or anybody
around her. In fact, we none of us can make her out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
What do you think now is the reason of this strange
reserve towards her own kindred?"</p>

<p>"Well, madam," I answered, "if I must tell you my
real opinion, her nature is an uncommon one, and can
only live in the society of other uncommon natures.
Her silence I attribute to an excessive sensitiveness,
which not rarely accompanies genius, and which proceeds
from a consciousness that she is not easily
understood."</p>

<p>"But surely, Mr. Blackdeed," said the lady of the
house, "one would expect that she would open her
heart to her own flesh and blood, rather than to a comparative
stranger like yourself."</p>

<p>"The idiosyncrasies of temperament, madam," said
I, "are difficult to explain. The mere accident of relationship
will not necessarily give a similarity of disposition.
Occasionally we do find one in a family totally
unlike the rest, and therefore misunderstood by them.
The reason why Miss Maud takes no interest in what is
conventionally termed society is that she feels above it.
She pants, as it were, for a higher atmosphere. For
this reason she prefers lone rambles and the contemplation
of beautiful nature, with no companion save her
own thoughts, to the artificial society of the ball-room,
with its insipid conversation.</p>

<p>"She evidently lives completely in a world of her
own, into which she will admit but very few. To judge
from her conversation, she seems excessively well read,
and acquainted with authors who rarely form a part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
young lady's education. You must have observed that
she reads very much. Indeed, I was perfectly astounded
at her research, as well as the originality of
her remarks."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the mother, "she is a very odd girl.
It is true that she is always reading. I have seen some
strange books, too, in her library, but to tell you the
truth, Mr. Blackdeed, neither myself nor any of the
family ever thought for a moment that she really had
anything in her. Her sisters look upon her as a perfect
ninny."</p>

<p>"A great mistake," I observed; "and if you will
take my advice, you will try to understand her better.
It may be difficult at first to get into her confidence. It
is a nature that requires great sympathy and encouragement
and if once ridiculed at any idea she expressed,
which to you might appear strange or wild, you may be
sure that she will close the doors of her confidence upon
you once again and for ever."</p>

<p>At this moment the master of the house came to
meet us, and inform us that dinner was ready. At
dinner time I was seated opposite Maud. She was
thoughtful and dreamy as usual all the while, and when
addressed by any of the family would start as if out of a
dream.</p>

<p>This peculiarity of hers was not taken notice of
either by the family or the servants, who were accustomed
to her eccentricity, and the dinner passed off
without any conversation worth recording. In the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
we assembled again to take a dish of tea together.
Maud was still silent and pensive, and while the others
were conversing together, I could not help admiring the
calm, intellectual serenity of her countenance.</p>

<p>I fell into a reverie, my eye being fixed upon her
with intense interest, when to my surprise and horror,
she suddenly fell back in her chair and became as one
lifeless.</p>

<p>"Maud! my dear, my dear!" exclaimed her mother,
"what can you be thinking of, to fall asleep like that in
company," while her two sisters, between whom she was
sitting, began to shake her, but to their surprise she felt
as rigid as a corpse in their hands, and appeared as
insensible.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" cried one of them, now really frightened.
"Send for the doctor."</p>

<p>Someone went to fetch a glass of cold water, but as
I never assisted any lady before in such a predicament,
and not knowing exactly what to do, I did not offer my
services until I was asked to support Maud, who was
falling off her chair, when I rushed suddenly to her aid,
and seizing her by the shoulders, replaced her on the
seat. My hands had no sooner touched her than she
again awoke, and opening her eyes sleepily, gazed about
her wonderingly.</p>

<p>It would seem as if my will that she should recover
were sufficient, for I touched her so gently that it was
impossible the mere touch could have awakened her
out of the deep magnetic trance I had unwittingly sent
her into.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you feel now, dear?" said her mother.
"What can be the meaning of this swoon? Has it ever
happened to you before?"</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>"I must consult a doctor about it," said her mother.
"It may be the beginning of a series of fits, and must
be looked into."</p>

<p>Wonderments on all hands were expressed as to
what could be the origin of this unexpected swoon, but
I saw from a look Maud gave me that she was aware
that it arose from my influence over her. Maud and
myself alone were in the secret, but I was more cautious
for the future, and dared not look too fixedly at her, for
fear of bringing on another trance. We spent many
happy days together while I was staying at this country
seat, and I enjoyed much of Maud's charming conversation.
But soon I was recalled to London to
continue my theatrical career, so I took leave of the
family, and started with the stage for London.</p>

<p>Hamlet was to be acted at our theatre, and it so
happened that a famous actor of ours had died, and the
part of Hamlet was allotted to me.</p>

<p>In the middle of my part I could not help wishing
to myself that Maud were present to see me act. The
wish was intense; nor was it mere vanity that prompted
it, but I really had a sincere respect for her opinion,
and she was that sort of girl who would have told me to
my face of any defect in my acting she noticed, for she
was a merciless critic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>I rather longed to hear my acting severely cut up by
her than to receive unqualified praise, although I was
sure that praise from her lips would be unfeigned.</p>

<p>The memory of Maud's face haunted me throughout
my part, but so far from being an impediment to me, I
fancied I acted better than usual, and I was anxious for
Maud to be present that I might hear her candid
opinion of my performance afterwards. I was in the
middle of that scene where Hamlet strains his eyes into
space after his father's ghost when I noticed the figure
of a lady seated in one of the boxes near the stage
which up to that time had been empty. Surprise at
seeing a lady alone whom I had not noticed before so
near the close of the piece caused me to look again.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! it was Maud herself. What could
she be doing in that box alone? Not even dressed for
the theatre, but wearing the identical dress I had seen
her last in, as if she were at home. I started, in spite
of myself. She seemed to heed no one, for her eyes
were constantly fixed on me. Her appearance there I
did not attempt to account for, but I felt a thrill of
delight that my acting was being appreciated by one
at least.</p>

<p>I inwardly resolved at the close of the last scene to
wrap my cloak hurriedly over my theatrical dress and
rush out to meet her before she stepped into her
carriage, but I was not in time, so I undressed and
leisurely returned home.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards I met the medical attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of the &mdash;&mdash; family in the street. I inquired after the
young ladies and especially Maud.</p>

<p>"It appears they are in London," said I.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied he. "Then it must be very
lately, for it was only on the tenth, in the evening, that I
was called for to attend upon Miss Maud, and they did
not say anything about coming to town."</p>

<p>"On the tenth!" exclaimed I, in amazement, "you
say you saw Miss Maud?"</p>

<p>This was the very evening I had seen her at the
theatre.</p>

<p>"Yes; on the tenth."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he said. "In the evening, at about
half-past nine."</p>

<p>"At half-past nine, on the tenth!" I exclaimed.
"Why, she was at the theatre at that hour. I saw her."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the doctor. "You must have
been mistaken; someone like her, perhaps."</p>

<p>"No, no, doctor," I firmly asserted; "I tell you she
was in a box near the stage while I was acting Hamlet.
I was as near to her as I am to you now; it is impossible
that I could be mistaken."</p>

<p>"But I tell you, you <i>are</i> mistaken, most grievously,"
said the doctor, somewhat warmly. "I give you my
word of honour as a medical man and a gentleman that
I attended Miss Maud at her own country house on the
tenth instant, at about half-past nine in the evening."</p>

<p>"Then it must have been her ghost I saw, that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
all," said I. "And do you know, doctor, that the most
strange part of it all was, she was perfectly alone in the
box, and not dressed for the theatre, but wore the very
same dress I saw her last in? I marked her well, and
wondering to myself what brought her there unaccompanied
and in such plain attire. It is true, she is
a little eccentric, but then her parents, I thought, would
have looked after her sufficiently to prevent such a
breach of etiquette. Really, doctor, I don't know what
to think of it."</p>

<p>"Come," said he, with a smile, "come, confess you
are a little smitten with the young lady. You can't
quite get her out of your thoughts, even while you are
acting. She has made a great impression on your over-sensitive
brain, and at the time perhaps your nerves
were a little unstrung from over study or over excitement
about your part, or else"&mdash;here he relaxed into another
smile&mdash;"are you quite, <i>quite</i> sure you did not take just
a <i>leetle</i> drop of <i>something</i> upon an empty stomach, just
to screw yourself up to the right pitch?"</p>

<p>And here he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Upon my honour, doctor," said I, "I am not in the
habit of having recourse to stimulants. I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me with a hearty laugh, and said,
"Ah! you actors are sad dogs."</p>

<p>I smiled and then after a moment's reflection said,
"By the way, doctor, for what were you called to
attend upon Miss Maud? I hope she is not dangerously
ill. What is her complaint?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the physician, gravely, "I am afraid it
is somewhat serious. She had a fit that appeared to
me to be cataleptic. It is the second she has had it
seems. It lasted for some considerable time, and
when she awoke she complained of a weight over her
eyeballs and an inclination to sleep, with a pain down
the whole right side of the body. She felt extremely
nervous, and asked for a fan, with which she begged
me to fan her powerfully, and afterwards to change the
movement, so as to cause the current of air to pass her
face in a transverse direction. This I did, after which
she declared that she had recovered."</p>

<p>I was startled at the doctor's relation, but said
nothing, for I was now more convinced than ever that
my intense desire for her to be present had influenced
her magnetically, and had been the means, though
unwittingly, of withdrawing her spirit temporarily from
the body. But what would have been the use of my
declaring my suspicions to such an old-fashioned fogey
as this worthy doctor? I should only have been
laughed at, so I held my peace.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," said I, after we had walked on
together for some time in silence, being occupied with
my thoughts, "if you have nothing else to do in the
evenings, now that you are in London, I should be
glad if you would drop in at our theatre to see me act.
This evening I am going to act Romeo again. If you
have any spare time, I can give you a box-ticket."</p>

<p>He thanked me, and said that as he was free that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
evening he would gladly accept my offer, so we parted.</p>

<p>The evening arrived, and when I made my appearance
on the boards I noticed my friend the doctor
already in his box. His appearance put me in mind of
the conversation we had had in the morning, and, do
what I could, I was unable to get Maud out of my
head all through the piece. I certainly <i>did</i> long for
her to be present, though I tried not to wish too
strongly, lest I should bring on another magnetic trance.
I glanced towards the box where I had last seen Maud.
It was occupied by two gentlemen, and Maud was not
there.</p>

<p>As the piece proceeded, however, I forgot my
caution, and an intense desire to see her again, which I
could not restrain, came over me. Shortly afterwards,
glancing casually towards the same box, which was just
opposite the doctor's, <i>I perceived Maud, dressed as on
the evening before</i>.</p>

<p>I was horror-struck, for I knew now that I saw
her spirit for certain, and that the body was nearly a
hundred miles off. The two gentlemen in the box did
not seem aware of her presence, while she looked
neither to the right nor to the left, but seemed thoroughly
absorbed in the piece. Her apparition there on that
night was not of such long duration as on the evening
of the tenth, probably because I was frightened at what
I had done and wished her spirit back to its earthly
tenement.</p>

<p>When I looked again towards the box after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
quarter-of-an-hour Maud was no longer there. At the
conclusion of the play I undressed hurriedly, and
sought my friend the doctor among the crowd, but I
could not find him, so I strolled into a supper room
hard by, just before returning home, and there at a
table I saw my friend.</p>

<p>"Hullo! doctor," said I, "so you have come to
refresh yourself after the fatigue of seeing me act, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," retorted he, merrily, "your capital
acting has quite given me an appetite."</p>

<p>After one or two complimentary speeches on his
part, I took my seat by his side and gave my orders to
a waiter.</p>

<p>"Doctor," I said, after a pause, "I saw her again
to-night."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Maud, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Bah! I'll tell you what it is, young man, you
want bleeding."</p>

<p>Pulling out his lancet, he wanted to bleed me on
the spot, but I refused to be bled.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, doctor," said I; "I haven't any more
blood than I know what to do with. I tell you I saw
<i>her</i> as distinctly as I see you now. She was in the
box opposite yours where those two gentlemen were,
but she did not seem to belong to them."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I saw those two gentlemen in the
box opposite mine, and I can take my oath there was
no one else there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mark my word," said I, "when you return to &mdash;&mdash; and
call on that family, you will be informed that
Maud has had another fit. This is the 15th. Mark
the day and the hour, and if she has not, I will lose
my right hand, or I will give you permission to
bleed me."</p>

<p>"What connection is there between her having a
fit and your imagining that you saw her at the theatre?
If she was at the theatre, I must have seen her as well
as you, and if she were in a fit this evening, how could
she be at the theatre?"</p>

<p>I pretended to be convinced by his arguments, but
forbore to explain myself further, merely adding:</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see&mdash;if you hear Maud has had a
fit on the evening of the 15th, at about the same hour
as the last one, you will let me know, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly."</p>

<p>At this moment the waiter returned with my supper,
and the conversation took a different turn; but after we
had finished and were returning home, he urged
me again to be bled or to try a little change of air, as
he observed that my nerves were evidently out of order.
Having arrived at the corner of a street, I shook hands
with my friend, and we parted. It was about a week
after our parting, on returning from a walk I found a
letter on my table. My servant told me that an elderly
gentleman had called and enquired if I were at home,
and receiving an answer in the negative, he had asked
for pen, ink, and paper, and left me the following lines:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Since I saw you last I have
received a letter from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; begging me to return
as soon as I conveniently could, as Maud had had
another fit on the evening of the 15th, between nine
and half-past&mdash;the very day and hour, you will
remember, you fancied you saw her in the box opposite
mine. I am not a believer in spiritual apparitions, and
therefore cannot set this down to anything more than a
very strange coincidence. I called at the house of
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and saw the whole family. When the lady
of the house had told me about Maud's fit, I afterwards
related to her, in the presence of the young lady herself,
the curious circumstance of her fancied appearance to
you in the stage box. Maud listened with great attention,
and seemed to take more interest in my recital
than the rest did, for afterwards, taking me apart, she
asked me many questions about you; when I had seen
you last, how you were, etc., etc. I returned to town
yesterday, and as you asked me to let you know if your
prophecy came true, I have left you this note. Till we
meet again,&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">John Merrivale.</span></p>

<p>How I triumphed inwardly on the perusal of this
letter! I placed it in my pocket, and taking my hat
and cane, I left my lodgings and walked about the
streets with a buoyant step, hoping to meet Merrivale,
just to crow over him for disbelieving my vision. I
would have called upon him, had I known his address,
but I saw no more of my friend&mdash;at least, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
time afterwards. It happened that on that very evening
a piece was being performed at our theatre in which I
did not act, and I thought I would be a spectator for
once in a way, so, from caprice, I took the very box in
which I had seen Maud. On entering the box I
experienced all the awe and veneration of a pious
devotee when he kneels at some holy shrine.</p>

<p>"This place has been visited by Maud's spirit," said
I to myself, as I shut myself in. "This is the very
chair she used."</p>

<p>I seated myself, and the curtain drew up. It was a
melodrama, if I remember rightly, which was acted that
night, but I was so occupied with my thoughts about
Maud, that I really cannot say with certainty what piece
it was. The audience applauded every now and then,
so I suppose it took well. As for myself, I had fallen
into a reverie of which Maud was the subject.</p>

<p>That stage box had for me a certain sanctity and
purity since the first time I had seen her there.
Whether it was that on this evening I had not my part
to think of and so felt my mind open to other thoughts
than those connected with my profession, or whether
this hallowed spot awoke in my breast certain feelings,
I know not, but certain it was that never had Maud so
thoroughly taken possession of my thoughts as on that
evening.</p>

<p>I attempted to analyse my thoughts. What was it
that I felt for Maud? What was it that made me think
more of her than of other girls? And why did I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
more and more about her every day? I hardly knew
myself how to answer these questions. Was it&mdash;could
it be&mdash;no&mdash;<i>love</i>, that I felt for her? No! it was not
that; at least, if it was, it was not like other men's love.
It was a feeling far purer, far loftier than falls to the lot
of ordinary men's experience. I thought that the world
did not&mdash;never did, nor ever could contain another
Maud. She was different to the rest of her kind. <i>Her</i>
beauty, <i>her</i> talents, <i>her</i> beautiful nature, could never
excite in me such a vulgar passion as that which the
world calls love. The thought never entered my head
to make her my own, and I was content to worship her
at a distance.</p>

<p>I began to wonder to myself if Maud could be aware
of the strong impression she had made upon me. I
even dared to hope, though humbly, very humbly, she
might not <i>quite</i> have forgotten <i>me</i>; that there was still
a spare corner in her memory&mdash;I had nearly said
<i>heart</i>&mdash;left vacant in which I might crave a home.</p>

<p>Did she, perhaps&mdash;here an electric shock ran through
me at the very thought&mdash;did she feel for me <i>exactly</i> in
the same way as I felt for her? Oh, rapture! and I
tried to persuade myself that she did, for the thought
comforted me.</p>

<p>"Ah, Maud, Maud," I muttered to myself, in the
midst of my reverie.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard the door handle move.</p>

<p>"Confound that box-keeper," muttered I. "What
can he want, coming to disturb my meditation?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened, and I turned my head to see who
it was. Gentlemen, will you believe it? It was Maud,
again dressed exactly the same as before. I started,
and my blood ran cold, my hair stood on end, my teeth
chattered, and my knees knocked together. I essayed
to speak, but my tongue refused to give utterance to
what I wished to say. I was then in the presence, nay
close to, a supernatural essence bearing the lineaments
of Maud, whose body I knew for certain to be at her
country seat, nearly a hundred miles away.</p>

<p>The figure gave me a friendly look of recognition,
and seated itself. I fancied it offered me its hand, but
I was too dumbfounded to accept it, and remained
stupefied. At length this excessive feeling of terror
began to wear off, and I ventured to say, in a low tone,
broken with emotion, "Maud, is it really you? Speak."</p>

<p>"William," said a voice proceeding from the lips of
the figure, but which sounded as if it came from a long
way off, "William!"</p>

<p>And there was the deepest pathos in the tone. It
was the first time I had been called thus by Maud.
When she was in the body she always called me Mr.
Blackdeed. I waited for some moments to hear if the
voice would say more.</p>

<p>After a long pause it spoke again, and said, "You
called me. Wherefore?"</p>

<p>"Called you, Maud!" said I. "I called you not."</p>

<p>"The concentration of your thoughts has had the
power to command my spirit from afar," said the figure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it so?" said I. "And can you not battle
against such commands?"</p>

<p>The figure replied not, save by a look, which
seemed to say, "When you command, no."</p>

<p>I understood the look, and felt flattered by its
meaning, but knew not how to respond, so I was silent
for some moments.</p>

<p>At length I said, "Maud&mdash;if I may call you Maud&mdash;tell
me, do you suffer much when withdrawn from the
body?"</p>

<p>"Less out of it than in it," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You know how I stand with my family," she said.</p>

<p>"True, true," I observed; "and this must cause you
great pain. However, I hope in time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never, never," she replied with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, why not? Do you not wish to live happily
with them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how willingly!"</p>

<p>"Then let me see if I cannot make matters a little
smooth for you. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head doubtfully, and said, "I feel
as if I did not belong to them nor they to me; in fact,
I feel as if I never belonged to anybody, nor ever
should."</p>

<p>"And never should!" exclaimed I. "Why, you do
not mean to say that&mdash;that&mdash;you never intend to
marry?"</p>

<p>"I fear I should make but an indifferent wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why so? I am sure you possess qualities that
many married ladies might envy. Of course, you would
require a husband who understood you and was able to
appreciate your virtues."</p>

<p>"You flatter me," she said. "Nevertheless, you
will see that I shall never marry. Mark my words. I
was not born for it. Do you know," she said, lowering
her voice, and speaking in a solemn tone, "that of late
I have had a strange presentiment that my end is not
far off."</p>

<p>"Now, really, Maud," said I, "pray do not talk like
that, for I sincerely hope that nothing more serious
than a little temporary indisposition has given rise to
such a presentiment."</p>

<p>"My health of late has been, if anything, better
than usual. I do not think this presentiment can be
reasonably accounted for in that way. At other times
when I have felt at all poorly such a thought has never
occurred to me."</p>

<p>I merely shook my head and said that I hoped she
would not encourage these presentiments.</p>

<p>"William," she said, "remember my words; I shall
not live till the year is out."</p>

<p>I did not know what to answer, and gazed upon her
in astonishment for some minutes, when suddenly her
face grew agonised, and she manifested symptoms of
impatience.</p>

<p>"What is it, Maud?" I asked. "What ails you?"
She seemed to have difficulty in answering, but I fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that I understood the words, "I am drawn to the body;
let me go."</p>

<p>And rising suddenly from her chair and gasping, she
made for the door, but disappeared from my sight
before she had time to reach it.</p>

<p>I remained stupefied at the figure's sudden disappearance,
as well as at the whole occurrence of the evening.
I knew not what to think. Had I been dreaming?
No. This was not the first time, either, that I had seen
her. I had been holding converse with no less a being
than Maud's ghost; her own pure and beautiful spirit,
drawn by my art from the body while yet breath
remained.</p>

<p>A horrid thought struck me. Perhaps I had
detained the spirit too long away from the body.
Perhaps there was no one in the house to wake her out
of her trance. I reproached myself for not foreseeing
the mischief that I might do, and returned home from
the theatre that evening with Maud more than ever in
my thoughts.</p>

<p>Next morning when I awoke, whether from the
excitement of the previous evening or from a cold
caught by walking home in the rain, or both combined,
perhaps, I found myself in a high fever. I was compelled
to remain in bed, though I was averse to sending
for the doctor until some days later, when I found the
fever grew rapidly worse.</p>

<p>A doctor was sent for&mdash;not my friend Merrivale, as I
knew not where he lived&mdash;and he attributed my illness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to over-study and want of proper exercise. I merely
mention my illness to tell you a dream which occurred
to me during a portion of it. I thought that I was
transported to realms of enchantment, and that whilst
the most beautiful scenery imaginable lay before me,
I heard in the distance soft strains of music and singing,
which gradually drew nearer and nearer to me.</p>

<p>The atmosphere seemed to fill with a delicious
perfume, and looking upwards, I descried a troop of
angels, bearing one with them who seemed lately of this
earth. The angels gradually descended, and left the
figure they carried with them at my feet, whilst they
flew upward. I instantly recognised in the figure
before me the features of Maud. She was dressed in a
long robe of white, and, with an expression in her
countenance too beautiful and too unearthly to describe,
she spoke these words:</p>

<p>"Farewell, William; we meet again," and vanished.</p>

<p>I awoke, and the dream remained impressed upon
my mind for a long time afterwards.</p>

<p>Recovering at length from my illness, I resumed my
duties at the theatre, where I was received with immense
applause after my long absence, and continued my
career with enthusiasm on my part and admiration on
the part of my audience. Night after night I would go
through my part, and week after week and month after
month passed away, and I neither heard nor saw
anything further of Maud since our strange meeting in
the stage box&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, on the 31st of December.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a violent desire to see her again would
seize me in the midst of my part, and I would glance
furtively towards the haunted spot, half expecting to
see her, but I never saw her again from that day to
this. The dream I had had concerning her during my
illness often recurred to me, and I wondered whether it
really was a revelation or only an ordinary dream to be
accounted for by the state of my health at the time.</p>

<p>I had seen no more of Maud's family, neither had I
again met our common friend the doctor or any other
friend of the family from whom I might learn the state
of Maud's health, or whether she were dead or alive.</p>

<p>A year or two passed away, when I was invited by
some friends of mine to spend a week or so at their
country seat, not very far from the seat of Maud's
family. I took the stage, and was put down at a
country inn, from whence I had to walk about a mile-and-a-half
to reach my friend's house. It was early in
the morning when I arrived at the inn, and not being in
a particular hurry to reach the house, thinking that the
family might not yet have risen, I sauntered leisurely
along the carriage road, halting occasionally and looking
around me. The whole scene&mdash;the air itself&mdash;seemed
to call up memories of Maud.</p>

<p>Absorbed in a reverie, I wandered on until I found
myself at the gate of a cemetery, which I mechanically
entered. I had passed the same cemetery often before
in my walks with Maud. What a picturesque old place
it was! Filled with old crumbling monuments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
quaint epitaphs and overgrown with rank grass and
weeds.</p>

<p>It was one of Maud's favourite spots for meditation,
as she told me. It was so perfectly solitary&mdash;overlooked
by no houses and shut out from the gaze of passers-by
with thick yew trees and cypress. Then, when you
entered at the gate, what a silence reigned within! I
love those grand old melancholy retreats, and so did
Maud. Here the rich and poor of the surrounding
villages for miles around were buried. I passed by the
elegant marble tombs of the wealthy and the humbler
grassy mounds of the peasantry. My thoughts were
filled with the shortness of human life, the vanity of its
noblest pursuits, and the equalling, never-sparing hand
of death.</p>

<p>Even the bracing morning air and the merry sunshine
were insufficient to dispel thoughts like these, for
the spot had a solemnity of its own about it. The
abode of the dead is at all times sacred to us, even when
we find it in the heart of a populous city, amidst the
bustle and stir of daily life; but how much more is it
sanctified when we discover it in some rural and
secluded spot ungrimed with the smoke of factories,
unbroken in upon by rude voices from without, and the
mossy stones and overgrown weeds and brambles of
which even the hand of the trim gardener has not disturbed.</p>

<p>I seated myself upon an ancient tomb, and gazed
around me. Here lay a knight of old, there a lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the manor; yonder some poor rustic whose humble
grave of turf bore no record of the name, age, or sex of
its occupant, what its owner's deeds had been on earth,
whether fruitful or unfruitful. Close beside it rose a
stately tombstone of white marble with a long inscription.
"Doubtless here lays some rich landowner," I
thought, "whose supposed virtues are here recorded in
full."</p>

<p>I was too far off to read what was inscribed, but the
tomb was a new one. It was not there when Maud and
I took our rambles together, and I recollected all the
most important gravestones. I rose and advanced a
few steps, when I suddenly halted a few paces from the
tomb, and recoiled in horror. I was seized with
trembling, my heart sank, and I felt my brow covered
with a cold sweat. The letters on the monument swam
before my eyes. I brushed away a tear as I read
the following lines:</p>

<div class="bk1"><span class="smcapl">SACRED TO THE MEMORY<br />
OF</span><br />
MAUD E&mdash;&mdash;N,<br />
<span class="smcapl">YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF</span> G<span class="smcapl">EORGE</span> E<span class="smcapl">&mdash;&mdash;N</span>,<br />
<span class="smcapl">OF &mdash;&mdash;<br />
WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE<br />
THE 31ST OF</span> D<span class="smcapl">ECEMBER</span>, 1750.<br />
<span class="smcapl">AGED 21 YEARS</span>.</div>

<p>Then followed one or two verses from the Bible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Maud, Maud!" I cried, in an agony, and
throwing myself on her grave, I wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"What says the gravestone? 'On the 31st of
December,'" said I to myself. "Good heavens! That
was the very evening on which I saw her spirit last in
the stage box!"</p>

<p>I had drawn her soul away from her body for too
great a length of time. <i>I</i> then was the cause of her
death. Poor Maud! She was right in saying she
should not live the year out, but I little thought that
when her spirit hurried from my presence on that fatal
night that it was then about to leave the body for ever.</p>

<p>I felt like a murderer. The thought that one so
good, so innocent, and so talented should meet with her
death through one so worthless as myself galled me.
My agony was insufferable. "Oh, Maud! would that
we had never met!" I cried aloud, for now, but, alas,
too late, I began to feel the consuming fire of an
intense love for her that in her lifetime was as yet
undeveloped; added to which were the stings of
remorse for my own careless, if not wicked, conduct.</p>

<p>I felt now that she had loved <i>me</i>. Why had I not
come forward before to crave her hand? Could I not
see that she loved me, though she confessed it not?
Fool that I was! Could I not have been happy with
her and made her happy? What was it that made me
draw back? I know not. There was something about
her which awed me, and kept me aloof.</p>

<p>Then, again, was I in a position at that time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
support a wife? Had I the right to come forward?
No, I answered myself, and this thought consoled me
somewhat, but had I not already allowed myself to be
carried away by a passion that had engulfed both her
and myself?</p>

<p>Love, grief, and remorse struggled in my breast for
the mastery. I wept aloud, and kissed the cold gravestone
fervently. I know not how long I might have
been thus, for in my anguish I took no count of time,
when I was suddenly aroused by a footstep behind and
a voice.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, who is this?" said the stranger.</p>

<p>I turned, and beheld my friend Merrivale. Whilst
taking his morning's walk as usual he had been attracted
by my lamentations, and curiosity led him to enter the
cemetery.</p>

<p>"Why, what the&mdash;I say&mdash;what! Is that <i>you</i>?" he
said, as I looked up abashed in the midst of my grief,
and knew not what to reply.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said he. "I understand all, I saw
all from the beginning. I am not surprised, you know,
with one of your temperament, but do you know, young
man, you might catch your death of cold, indulging
your grief in the morning dew on a cold gravestone.
You must be&mdash;really, my dear sir&mdash;you must be insane."</p>

<p>"Doctor," said I, "we may meet another time, when
I may have more to say to you. For the present leave
me. I arrived here early this morning, having been
invited to a friend's house. It is time for me to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
my appearance. Till we meet again, farewell. And,
doctor," said I, "you will keep this matter secret, eh?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said he, with a smile which seemed to
me forced in order to disguise his emotion, for I noticed
that he turned away his head suddenly, shook my hand,
and walked away hurriedly.</p>

<p>We had both of us left the cemetery, and about
half-a-mile further on led me to the door of my friend's
house.</p>

<p>I tried to assume an air of indifference before my
friend, and discoursed on various topics; nevertheless,
he noticed that my hand trembled, and that I
seemed distracted. I said I had been a little out of
health lately, and was glad of a little change of air.</p>

<p>"My doctor, Mr. Merrivale," said he, "will be here
to-day to look at the children. If you would like to
see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you; but I hope it is nothing
worth mentioning."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Merrivale arrived, and I managed
to find an opportunity of speaking with him alone. I
inquired after the family E&mdash;&mdash;n, and was informed
that Maud had died suddenly in a trance, and he had
been called too late. That her two sisters were engaged
to be married. That Maud had spoken much of me
before her last fit, and had given out some strange
mysterious hints of a certain power I had over her, and
nothing could induce her mother and sisters to believe
otherwise than that I had cast an evil spell over her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>He added that her father was more reasonable, and
did not believe in those things. The family would be
sure to hear of my arrival in the village, therefore I
resolved to call on an early opportunity. I did so, and
was well received by Maud's father, he having been
intimate with mine, but by the mother and sisters
with rigid coldness. They did not even offer me their
hand. I expected this, but nevertheless felt it my duty
to call. I made some slight allusion to Maud's death
in as delicate a way as I could, but was checked in the
midst of my remarks by scornful glances from the
mother and sisters.</p>

<p>I left the house, and I need hardly say that this was
my last call on that family, although the master of the
house wrung my hand cordially, and said he should be
always glad to see me when chance led me to those
parts.</p>

<p>I returned to my friend's house, where I tried to
divert myself with a week's shooting. I frequently
met my friend Merrivale. We used to take walks
together sometimes. In one of our rambles I recounted
to him all the particulars of the evening of the 31st of
December, when I had last seen and spoken to Maud
in the spirit at the theatre.</p>

<p>He marvelled, but was silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By the time the tragedian had finished his recital,
our friends had arrived at the door of the inn, where
their host's pretty daughter waited to receive them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Helen, my dear," said Mr. Oldstone. "Is
the breakfast ready? We have had a long story, and
we are all very hungry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the maiden; "everything is on
the table. I'll run and fetch the eggs. I put them in
to boil when I saw you coming in the distance. The
toast and rolls are hot, and all in order."</p>

<p>"Bravo! Helen, bravo!" said Professor Cyanite,
rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"By my troth, Helen," said our artist, "if I wanted
an appetite your bright eyes would be enough to give
me one."</p>

<p>Helen blushed and smiled, and skipped lightly away
to see after the eggs.</p>

<p>"Ah! here is a breakfast fit for a king," said Mr.
Crucible, as Helen re-entered with a tray.</p>

<p>"And all made with her own fair hands, too, I'll
warrant," said McGuilp.</p>

<p>"What makes you blush so much of late, Helen?"
asked Mr. Hardcase.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a shame to tease the poor child," said
Mr. Parnassus, with tenderness.</p>

<p>"Ah! Helen," sighed Dr. Bleedem, "your health
and rosy cheeks are worth all my drugs."</p>

<p>"'I would I were a glove upon that hand, that I
might touch that cheek,'" quoted the tragedian from his
favourite "Romeo and Juliet."</p>

<p>"Order, order!" cried various other members at
once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment our host entered to call away his
daughter, so Helen was spared further banter.</p>

<p>As the meal proceeded the company began to dispute
who should tell the next story. Of those present
who had not yet entertained the company with a tale
were Mr. Crucible and Mr. Oldstone. One of the two
<i>must</i> tell a story, as the club decreed, but as each of
these gentlemen wished to lay the burden of the story
upon the shoulders of the other, nothing seemed likely
to be settled.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after the breakfast things had been
removed dice were called for, and it was agreed that
whoever should throw the highest should tell the story.
Our host soon returned with the dice-box, and remained
to see which of the two gentlemen should throw
the higher number.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone seized the dice-box, and shaking it
well, threw double five. It was now Mr. Crucible's
turn, so taking the dice-box from the hand of the first
thrower, and rattling it twice or thrice, he threw the
number twelve.</p>

<p>"Now then, Crucible," said Mr. Oldstone, laughing,
"no shirking, but let us have the story at once."</p>

<p>"What! so soon after breakfast!" exclaimed Mr.
Crucible, "and before we have had time to digest the
last properly."</p>

<p>"I hope you will excuse my presence here
gentlemen," said Mr. Hardcase, "for I have a case to
attend to."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now really, Hardcase, that's too bad," ejaculated
Mr. Oldstone.</p>

<p>At this moment a servant arrived hurriedly at the
"Headless Lady," to call away Dr. Bleedem to see a
patient.</p>

<p>"Really, gentlemen," said the doctor, "I am very
sorry, but business <i>is</i> business."</p>

<p>"Business! business!" exclaimed Mr. Oldstone, in
horror at such a word being uttered within the sacred
precincts of the club. "Business! Ugh!"</p>

<p>Professor Cyanite, too, had a great scientific work
which he was getting ready for the press, and begged
also to be allowed to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Oldstone, "this is
really very provoking. I cannot think what ails you all
this morning. Since our club is reft of three such
staunch members, there seems nothing else to be done
but to defer the story until the evening, when there will
be no excuse for anyone to be absent."</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and the remaining inmates of
the "Headless Lady" began to while away the time
each after his own manner. Our artist began a portrait
of the landlord's pretty daughter. Mr. Blackdeed, who
was only here for the holidays, sat to work to finish a
tragedy that he had begun. Mr. Parnassus composed
an ode. Mr. Crucible retired to his chamber to try
some chemical experiment, and Mr. Oldstone, finding
himself deserted, had nothing left him to do but to look
over his cabinet of curiosities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us return to our artist and his model. How
happy they both are! Both of them young and good-looking,
and left all to themselves. With what inspiration
the hand of the painter glides over his canvas, and
how the face of the pretty Helen brightens up every
time the artist refreshes his memory by taking a peep at
her from behind his easel. There is no affectation in
the expression or the pose of the sitter, it is quite easy
and natural, and beautifully simple. She does not
seem conscious she is sitting for her portrait.</p>

<p>Every now and then, after working in silence for
some twenty minutes or so, McGuilp breaks the
monotony by some pleasing remark or question, to
which the maiden replies charmingly. Sometimes she
in her turn will ask him questions about Italy, and
whether the country and the people are the same as in
England.</p>

<p>"No, Helen," McGuilp replies; "not the same.
Italy is warmer, the sky bluer, and grapes grow in the
open air along the road side. The people's faces are
darker and their language more musical than ours.
They are all Roman Catholics; but, alas, the government
is bad, and the country is infested with brigands,
who attack travellers in the mountains and sometimes
keep them as hostages till their friends can be sent for
to pay any ransom they may choose to ask, in default
of which their victims are tortured and maimed in the
most inhuman manner."</p>

<p>"Oh, what horrid wretches! I was just going to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
before you told me that, what a paradise Italy must
be to live in! But I don't think I should like to live
there now."</p>

<p>"Well, these are drawbacks, I admit," said McGuilp,
"but, nevertheless, Italy is a very charming country.
Fancy a land where every peasant makes his own wine&mdash;good
wine, and cheap, too. What merrymakings they
have, too, on their feast days, and how picturesque their
costume!"</p>

<p>"Ah! do tell me how they are dressed. I should
so like to know."</p>

<p>"Would you, Helen?" said McGuilp. "Then, as
the sitting is now at an end, being past twelve o'clock,
I will let you look over my portfolio. You will find
some studies that I have made both of men and women
in the costumes of the Roman peasantry."</p>

<p>"Oh, do show them to me," exclaimed Helen, in
delight. "I am so curious to see what they are like.
Did you say it was past twelve o'clock? I began my
sitting at nine, and it does not seem to me more than
half-an-hour that I have been here."</p>

<p>And I have no doubt she spoke the truth. Happy
moments are short. Alas! how rapidly time glides
away in youth, and how provokingly long it appears
when we have most reason to wish it should pass
quickly. As Helen was engaged in admiring the studies
and sketches of McGuilp our host knocked at the door
to ask if his daughter could be spared, as her mother
wanted her aid in the affairs of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," said McGuilp; "but I must have
another good sitting to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. May I be permitted to look at the
portrait?" asked the landlord.</p>

<p>"You may look," replied our artist; "but I warn
you the likeness is not striking at present."</p>

<p>"Gramercy, sir!" exclaimed the landlord, in ecstasy;
"if it is not my girl herself already!"</p>

<p>"Ah! my good host, wait until I have had some
half dozen sittings or so, and then look again," said
McGuilp.</p>

<p>Our landlord then looked approvingly over our artist's
portfolio, and said, "Ah, sir, it is a noble art."</p>

<p>Helen was delighted with her portrait, of course, and
equally so with the contents of the portfolio. McGuilp
complimented her upon her sitting, and Helen disappeared
for the present.</p>

<p>At one o'clock Helen reappeared with the lunch,
and those members of the club who remained at home
met again over their frugal meal. They whiled away
the time until the evening with politics and a rubber at
whist.</p>

<p>At length the village clock struck the dinner hour,
and all guests were present. The dinner passed off
merrily, and all awaited the story anxiously. Our host
and his daughter were invited to hear it, so having filled
their pipes and stirred the fire, Mr. Crucible, finding
himself loudly called upon, took a sip at his port and
began his story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>The Spirit Leg.&mdash;The Analytical Chemist's
Story.</h3>

<p>Being left an orphan at an early age, I was consigned
to the care of a bachelor uncle, one Admiral Broadside,
who instructed me almost entirely himself until I
reached the age of twelve. I was then sent to school,
where I went through a routine of learning taught to
boys at that time, and though I was backward in many
things when I first entered the school, I was a persevering
scholar, and soon left behind me many boys who
had the start of me. I thus made enemies, and being
of a retiring disposition, owing to my previous education,
I made but few friends.</p>

<p>But let me return to my uncle. I have the liveliest
recollection of the old man with his weather-beaten face,
his deep-set eyes, and over-hanging black eyebrows,
resembling a moustache rather than the feature we
usually see in their place. Well I remember the sheen
and the lustre of that rubicund nose, sprouting with grog-blossoms,
the iron-grey hair, and long pig-tail; his
spectacles, with glasses as big as a crown piece, his
cocked hat, his uniform adorned with medals, and his
hobbling gait&mdash;for he had lost his right leg in an engagement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and used as a substitute a wooden one. How
well I can call to mind his nautical language and his
merry laugh; but, alas, I remember too well also his
angry frown, and the sundry thwackings that I got with
a "cat-o'-nine-tails," when I had "offended against
discipline."</p>

<p>From an infant he tried to instil into my young mind
the glories of a sea-faring life, and what a grand thing it
was to fight for the honour and glory of one's country.
He told me that he had great interest in the navy, and
if I turned out a worthy nephew of his, he would get
me on in my career, and that he hoped I should never
disgrace his name by showing the white feather and
turning landlubber.</p>

<p>He tried to influence my youthful imagination with
stories of sea-fights, the capture of pirates, the manners
and customs of foreign countries, the merry crew on
board, etc. He would cut out boats for me from blocks
of wood, and would rig out and launch them in a fish
pond in a garden behind his house.</p>

<p>Up to a certain period in my youth my uncle's
nautical stories and his promises of pushing me on in
life, if I answered his expectations, fired my ambition,
and I could talk of nothing else than of going to sea.</p>

<p>My uncle having no children of his own, looked
upon me as his son, and said that I was just the
sort of boy for him. He would praise me to his friends
and before my face, but his eulogium of myself lasted
only during the time I lived with him&mdash;namely, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
he sent me to school, for at school a great change came
over me, and my uncle noticed with regret upon my
return for the holidays the growing coolness in me towards
a sea-faring life; in fact, that my tastes had begun
to develop themselves in quite another direction.</p>

<p>Away from the influence of my guardian, I had
dared to breath in a new atmosphere, and to find out
that there were other walks in life quite as noble, and to
me much more fascinating than that of the sea. The
term "landlubber" conveyed no disparagement to my
ears now. I merely saw in it the venting of the spleen of
an egotistical and narrow mind. How paltry that class of
men must be which speaks with disparagement of all
others who do not happen to be within its own narrow
circle.</p>

<p>I was ashamed of myself for ever having been led
away by such false opinions, and had many a hot dispute
with my guardian about his illiberal notions. Now,
the admiral had a temper of his own; he was not a man
accustomed to be thwarted. He had made up his mind
that I was to go to sea, and to sea he was determined
to send me, whether I willed it or no.</p>

<p>I was now about fourteen, and since I had been
away from home I had imbibed strong notions of independence.
I did not see that any man had a right to
dispose of me as he thought fit. I felt myself a free
agent, and my youthful blood rose at the cool way in
which my uncle thought to bend me to his will. Had I
not the right to seek my own walk in life? Was I to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
baulked of my true avocation because I was told that
my interest lay elsewhere? Interest! Bah! I despised
interest.</p>

<p>My uncle promised me that if I went to sea he
would leave all his fortune to me, as I was his heir, and
if I refused, he would not leave me a groat. What
then? I had a small income left me by my father when
I should come of age, which was enough to keep me
like a gentleman. What did I want with the old
admiral's money? I was not going to sell myself for
filthy lucre.</p>

<p>It was whispered that the old man had amassed a
considerable fortune, and I should be called a fool by
the world to quarrel with him. But was my will to be
bought with gold? I was grateful to him for what he
had already done for me, and I never wished to quarrel
with him; but when I saw that he expected as a proof
of my gratitude I should humour his whim by sacrificing
my highest ambition in life to follow a profession
I now really cared nothing about, I felt it my duty to
rebel against my guardian and choose my own course.</p>

<p>I felt myself born for something better than a sea-faring
life. The sea might be very well for those who
had a taste for it, or for those who were fit for nothing
else. Besides, sailors are generally such ignorant people,
and I flattered myself that I had a mind to cultivate
and resolved to devote myself to study.</p>

<p>My hobby was science, and the branch I was chiefly
anxious to excel in, chemistry. I believe the first thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that fired my imagination to pursue this delightful
science was the reading a book lent me by a friend,
entitled, "Lives of the Alchemists." From this I
learned how many clever men had devoted their lives
and fortunes in pursuit of the philosopher's stone. I do
not remember reading any of them actually <i>did</i> make
gold; but the perseverance and energy of these men!
There was something sublime in a man of means giving
up the wealth and luxury of his position to follow
science. How I loved to read of these persevering
sages, of their trials and disappointments, and how,
heedless of all vicissitudes, they still pursued to the last
with unflagging energy that science that they alone lived
for. I had no doubt that in early times there was
an immensity of superstition mingled with their
science.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, thought I, is it possible that so many
clever men should have wasted their whole lives in
study and have been just upon the point of discovering
the secret if there were really nothing in it at all? I inquired
of a chemist in our town whether he believed in
the possibility of making gold. He told me that he did
not; but then a learned man with whom I once conversed
said that he was of opinion that it <i>was</i> possible,
but added that if the secret were discovered it would
certainly be valueless.</p>

<p>I preferred leaning towards the opinion of the learned
man who believed in the possibility of making gold out
of baser metals, and resolved to give the study of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
life to the discovery of the secret without letting others
know what I was striving after.</p>

<p>It happened that the chemist of our town whose
opinion I had consulted as to the probability of success
in alchemy sent his son, with whom I was rather intimate,
to the same school as my guardian had put me
at. He was a lad of my own years, and shared my
taste for study. Having much in common, we soon
struck up a warm friendship, which lasted for many
years; in fact, until his death, some fifteen years back.
I may assert that he was the only friend I ever had in
my youth, for I was a reserved lad, and did not court
friendship. He, too, was reserved, and sought no other
friend but myself.</p>

<p>We were always in each other's company, and used
to be nicknamed Castor and Pollux by the other boys.
They could none of them understand why we two withdrew
ourselves from the rest and refused to join in their
games, and they wondered much what we found to talk
about one to the other. We were both looked upon as
unsociable, and accordingly disliked.</p>

<p>We both of us had high aspirations, and each of us
felt the value of his existence, and that high honours
awaited him in posterity, if not in this life, provided that
he made the best use of his abilities. We might each
of us have been about fifteen, when we swore an eternal
friendship, and likewise to keep secret from others the
nature of our studies. When I returned home from
school for good&mdash;being then about seventeen&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
uncle the admiral was in despair at finding me more
than ever confirmed in my views of a studious life, and
said I had disappointed his hopes, and that I need
henceforth hope for no help from him.</p>

<p>A gentleman who visited my uncle, and who seemed
to take an interest in me, seeing that I was a young
man of some promise, advised me to go to a German
university, and recommended to me the university of
Jena.</p>

<p>He took upon himself to remonstrate with my guardian
upon what he called his harsh treatment of myself, and
told him that he had no right to force me against
my true calling, but his words were as wind in the
admiral's ears, for he was as obstinate as a mule.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, sir," said the admiral,
"that my boy can't be made a sailor of, if he is only
properly brought up?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said his friend; "it is precisely that point I
wish to discuss. I deny that we are all born alike; and
if you force this young man to go to sea you will make
a bad sailor of him when he might have done honour to
his country in another way."</p>

<p>"Boys mustn't be allowed to go just any way they
like. They must learn discipline and obedience. I
tell you that it is to his interest to go to sea. He is my
heir, and if he conducts himself properly he may hope
to be pushed on in life as long as I live, and inherit my
fortune at my death. If he refuses, I shall cut him off,
so he knows what to expect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sincerely regret your harsh determination," said
the gentleman, "for I really consider your nephew a
young man of great promise. He is studiously inclined,
and in every way shows that the sea is about the very
last calling for which he is destined. Why should you
try to waste his young life in a profession which he is
unfit for?"</p>

<p>"Unfit for!" exclaimed the admiral. "Unfit for!
In my time there was no talk of a lad's being unfit to
serve his country at the bidding of those in authority
over him, unless he was a cripple. Is not my nephew
strong and well built enough for the sea? Why should
he be unfit?"</p>

<p>"Not physically unfit," said his friend. "I do not
doubt for a moment his physical capabilities, but if he
has formed other tastes, and feels himself called in
another direction, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, sir, nonsense! about his feeling himself
called in another direction. He ought to feel himself
called where his interest lies, to say nothing of his duty
towards those placed over him," said my uncle.</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't make a slave of the boy?" said
his friend.</p>

<p>"I only wish to call him to his senses, to make him
do that which is best for himself. Am I to yield to a
mere boyish whim, for which he himself would be sorry
later in life? And as to his having no taste for it; he
was full of it whilst he lived under my roof, before he
went to school. It is only since he left me that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
got these new-fangled notions and hoisted the white
feather."</p>

<p>"I do not see that it is any sign of cowardice to
have changed his opinions since he was under your roof.
Since then his mind has become more enlarged, and he
is better able to see what he is fit for than when he had
received no other instruction than your own. Since
then he has made acquaintances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And pretty acquaintances he has made! About
the only acquaintance that he has is the son of a d&mdash;&mdash;d
apothecary, who happens to be at the same school. Do
you think I can't see from whom he has picked up his
sickly notions? Should I be doing my duty to my
brother's son were I to aid him in his insane hobby of
turning apothecary? To allow one of <i>my</i> family, one
of my own flesh and blood, to make pills and spread
plaisters for a living, when he might be boarding the
enemy's fleet and shedding his blood for the honour
and glory of his country? Why damme, sir, it's not
manly, I'll be hanged if it is."</p>

<p>"Because he may have formed some acquaintances
with this apothecary, doesn't necessarily show that he
intends to turn apothecary himself. He says that he
wishes to devote himself to the study of chemistry.
Surely there is nothing disgraceful in that! Perhaps
his determination may not be quite fixed as yet. He
wishes to go to the university, where he will receive the
education of a gentleman, and after a few years of study
he will be enabled to settle down in that walk of life
which suits him best."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the meantime he is wasting the flower of his
youth in moping study, whilst he might be earning his
laurels at sea."</p>

<p>"Life, my dear admiral, is a playground on which
numbers meet to play at a vast variety of games. You
have won your laurels at sea; let the poor boy earn his in
the game he most delights in. We are not all born alike."</p>

<p>"Bah! Laurels gained at pills and poultices. Much
good may his laurels do him. If he is wise, he will
forget at once his low acquaintances, awaken to his real
interest, and take a cruise with me. I have no doubt
that after a time I shall set him to rights again."</p>

<p>"And if he refuses to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;why, he may as well begin to
mix drugs at once, and the sooner the better."</p>

<p>"You mean that you would cut him off."</p>

<p>"Ay, that I most decidedly should."</p>

<p>"Now, my dear admiral, don't you think it would
be kinder, as well as the best way to save the honour of
your family, to try and prevent him from following the
apothecary's business by doing what you can to aid his
studies, that he may choose some other gentlemanly
profession besides the sea, since he seems to have taken
such an aversion to it?"</p>

<p>"No, no; my determination is fixed. If he does
my will I will help him in what way I can. If he will
not, neither will I help him in anything. He knows
what he has to expect, either the sea and my portion
when I die, or pills, poultices, and beggary."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"I much regret your stern decision, I must say,"
said the gentleman, and here the conference ended.</p>

<p>I was well aware of the admiral's decision, and that
nothing on earth could move him; and as I was equally
determined not to go to sea, I informed him how I had
decided.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "from to-day you are no
longer nephew of mine. Follow your own silly inclinations,
but don't hope for any help from me."</p>

<p>I considered myself turned out of the house, so I
quietly packed up my things, and without taking leave
of my uncle, I called upon my uncle's friend, the
gentleman who had shown so much interest in my cause
and explained how I was situated. I told him that I
had money left me by my father, which I could not
touch until I came of age. In the meantime I might
die of want, as my uncle had refused positively to call
me his nephew any longer. Therefore I begged him to
be kind enough to lend me a sufficient sum to complete
my studies at a foreign university, and I would repay
him when it lay in my power.</p>

<p>My uncle's friend was a man of means and of a
generous disposition, and not likely to see me go down
thoroughly in the world, granted my request. I left my
native town without letting my uncle know, and
departed for Germany. I found my way to the
university of Jena, where I entered and commenced
my studies.</p>

<p>My first step was to perfect myself in the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
language, to accomplish which I took lessons, visited
the theatre, and went into society. The romance that
seemed to attach itself to the life of a German student
had long inflamed my youthful fancy, and I entered a
"chor," or company of students, who distinguish themselves
from others by their own especial "tricolor,"
which they wear in a ribbon across their chests and
round their caps, and from ordinary mortals by their
otherwise fantastic way of dressing themselves.</p>

<p>The novelty of this life, rather than the life itself,
charmed me; for though I was delighted with the
freedom and goodfellowship amongst these young men,
I was not a youth naturally given to excess, and I soon
found that a little of this sort of life went a long way.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the beginning my fondness for the
study of human nature in all its phases induced me to
take part in all the manners and customs of my companions.
I joined them at their "kneipe," drank and
sang with them, smoked with them, fought with them.
I never refused a challenge, and sometimes even provoked
a duel. I was never behind hand in any midnight
brawl. I wore high boots and enormous spurs;
gambled, betted, serenaded, played practical jokes, and
soon got the reputation of a "flotter bursch" or rowdy
fellow.</p>

<p>As every German student has his "Liebchen," I,
too, had mine. A fair Teutonic damsel of good family
deigned to smile on me, and there was much talk at one
time in the little town of Jena about Fr&auml;ulein von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Hammelstengel and the handsome Englishman being
"verlobt."</p>

<p>People will talk at all times, and when news is
wanting&mdash;what so easy as to invent? All the inhabitants
of the town of Jena thought that they had a right
to know and to talk of my private affairs, and seeing
that I was of a reserved disposition and that they were
not likely to extract much from me by pumping, it
began to be rumoured abroad that I had certain grave
reasons for maintaining secrecy, and in a very short
time it was reported that I was a great "my lord,"
travelling in disguise for political purposes, and that I
possessed a fortune of countless millions of pounds
sterling.</p>

<p>This interesting discovery soon reached the ears of
the parents of the already-mentioned young lady, who,
by the way, had other admirers besides myself, and I
could not without vanity at that time fairly consider
myself the favoured one. Nevertheless, from the time
the report of my fabulous riches spread throughout the
whole university town I suddenly found Fr&auml;ulein von
Hammelstengel thrust in my way in the most obtrusive
manner.</p>

<p>If I went to the theatre she was sure to be blocking
up the doorway as I entered. If I was invited to a
party, she was sure to be there. If I went to a public
beer garden, there she was again; in the streets, in
church&mdash;everywhere.</p>

<p>At the time I speak of I had but little experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the world, but that little sufficed for me to see the trap
that was laid for me. I was amused at the farce played
before me, but disgusted with the actors, and resolved
to withdraw myself.</p>

<p>Now, Miss von H. was a very fair specimen of the
German upper classes. Besides being pretty, she could
cook, knit stockings, do every sort of household work,
had a very nice voice, and was a very excellent performer
on the pianoforte. She was amiable, and
possessed all the qualities of a good housewife. I may
even confess that she was not quite indifferent to me at
this time, but when I saw that her parents were making
a bait of her to catch me, I was awed at the hook, and
meditated escape.</p>

<p>I therefore prepared to undeceive the family as to
the state of my finances, giving out that I was only a
poor student who, unable to make both ends meet in
my own country, had retired to the continent to live
cheaper. This I confided to the young lady herself,
and it was evidently soon after repeated to the parents,
for a marked change in their behaviour soon manifested
itself towards me, which was not only what I expected,
but what I wished for. However, after a time it was
reported in the town that I could not be as poor as I
pretended to be, as it was remarked that I always paid
my bills&mdash;a somewhat rare occurrence among German
students&mdash;that I was always well dressed, lived well, had
given wine parties, and had books expensively bound.</p>

<p>Now, when the von Hammelstengels heard this last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
report, they began again to believe in all that they had
been told of me at first, and rather than let their prey
escape so easily, they resolved to make another effort,
and commenced to weave their meshes around me again.</p>

<p>In vain I repeated that I was only a poor student,
and could not hope to marry. I saw that I was not
believed, and was persecuted more than ever with
attentions. Mrs. von Hammelstengel grew so amiable,
that I was quite alarmed. Her husband so cordial and
obsequious, that I grew disgusted. The "fr&auml;ulein"
herself so languishing and sentimental that I saw that
there was nothing open for me but flight, so informing
them all that important family affairs had called me
suddenly back to England, I bade them a hasty farewell,
and shut myself up in my own lodging for a time.</p>

<p>Now, this stratagem was discovered by the brother
of Miss von Hammelstengel, an officer in the army. He
met me about two months after I had taken leave of the
family, and having ascertained that I had been in Jena
all the time, and had never mentioned to anyone else
my intention of returning to my country, he came to
the conclusion that my retirement was nothing but a
"ruse" to free myself from the clutches of his family.</p>

<p>He could not let me slip without playing his last
card, which was to frighten me into marriage if possible.
With this object he managed to pick a quarrel with me,
asking me if I thought it was behaving like a gentleman
to excite hopes in the breast of a young and innocent
girl, and then absconding, saying that he could not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
his sister pining away day by day without taking her
cause in hand, etc.</p>

<p>There was nothing left me, he said, but to marry
his sister or to fight him. My decision was soon
made. I told him that I would never be forced into
marriage through fear of a wound, and I resolved to
fight him.</p>

<p>An officer in the army is the only grade of man that
a German student deigns to fight with. All others are
beneath his notice. Now, as my adversary was an
officer, it was considered no degradation on my part to
accept the challenge, so weapons were provided, compliments
exchanged between seconds, and the adversaries
met.</p>

<p>The offence towards his family was seen in such a
grave light by my foe, that instead of the ordinary
method adopted by German students&mdash;the use of the
customary leaden collar, and pads to protect the more
vital parts&mdash;nothing would satisfy him but a duel with
the sabre, without pads and bandages.</p>

<p>This is the most terrible challenge, save that with
the pistol, but I did not shrink from it. I left a letter
directed to the gentleman in England who had lent me
the money to pursue my studies at the university in
the hands of my second, to be posted in case of my
death, and hastened to meet my adversary. The fight
was short, though desperate. My adversary fell severely
wounded in the arm. Parties tried to hush up the
matter, but of course the town was soon full of it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
story of the duel was variously told. Some said that I
had vanquished the captain, and others that he had
vanquished me; but the truth soon oozed out.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein von Hammelstengel subsequently married
an old count, who was supposed to be rich, but who
proved afterwards not to possess a penny.</p>

<p>But to return to myself. Disgusted with my experience
of human nature, and of womankind in particular,
I set to work now more diligently than ever.
Bade farewell to my "chor," and gave up rioting and
revelling, and wrote to my school friend the chemist's
son to come and join me in my studies. I also wrote a
letter to the gentleman who had kindly furnished me
with funds to continue my studies abroad, and in due
time I received the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Charles.</span>&mdash;I am delighted to hear that
you have at length settled down again to earnest study.
I hope you will not get into any more scrapes, or another
time you may not get off scot-free. Duelling is a very
wicked and a very silly practice, and does no credit to
either party; therefore I hope you will never seek a
quarrel, but do all you can to steer clear of pugnacious
persons. You have now been more than a year at the
university, and you write so seldom that you leave me in
the dark as to what progress you have made during your
stay. I wish you would write oftener, as I am very much
interested to know how you are getting on. Now for a
bit of home news. Your uncle the admiral, shortly after
your departure, took to himself a young and pretty wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
I am afraid, however, instead of the happy home he
contemplated, he sees too late that he has done a foolish
thing. She is a desperate flirt, and rumours of such a
nature are afloat in the town, that I should not be surprised
if before long he sues for a divorce. He has
never been the same man since you left, and looks considerably
older. The disappointment that he felt at
your determination to go your own way instead of his has
been indeed a great blow to him. I constantly remonstrated
with him on his views of your conduct towards
him, but you know how obstinate he is. He grumbles
that you left his house in a huff without even taking
leave of him, but he has never had the curiosity to ask
what has become of you, and hasn't an idea that I know
of your whereabouts.</p>

<p>"I called at your friend's the chemist's yesterday.
His son told me that you had written to him advising
him to join you in Jena. He would be delighted
to go, and I do not think his father is averse to
sending him. He is a superior lad, and I am not prejudiced
enough to advise you to cut his acquaintance on
the mere ground of his having been born in a humbler
sphere of life than yourself. The admiral may have his
prejudices, and to a certain extent I agree with him;
that is to say that one ought rather to seek acquaintances
within his own class than out of it. Still, when
we meet a man of superior mind in a class a little below
our own, I see no reason why we should draw the line
of society too tightly. I must now leave off, and hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that you will take care of your health, as well as improve
in your studies,&mdash;I remain, yours very truly,</p>

<p class="rgt">"<span class="smcap">Edward Langton.</span>"</p>

<p>Here was news indeed! My old bachelor uncle&mdash;he
who when he was merry used to laugh at the foibles
of the fair sex and ridicule married men&mdash;had himself
been betrayed into marrying one of those frail beings he
professed to despise. All the experience of his long life
had vanished like smoke before the sunshine of his
charmer. He had been dazzled with her eyes, and had
taken a step in the dark, and found himself, too late, in
the quagmire of remorse.</p>

<p>Poor old fool! I sincerely pitied him. "This
comes," said I to myself, "of turning nephews out of
doors. Had you, instead of trying to bend the iron
resolve of your nephew to your own poor old obstinate
will, assisted him in his very laudable determination to
follow science, you might yet have lived and died a
bachelor to your heart's content. But console yourself,
my uncle, St. Anthony was tempted by a fair demon
before you. Now you have learned a lesson, although it
has come somewhat late in life."</p>

<p>Although I deeply sympathised with my guardian's
mistake, I could not do otherwise than feel that he fully
deserved this punishment for his treatment of myself.
How absurd and arrogant of a man, to persist in
bending another to his own selfish will! Are we free
agents, or are we not?</p>

<p>But enough of this. My uncle had sinned, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
was punished. He had imagined his charmer an angel,
and found after all that she was but mortal like the rest
of her sex, a poor, weak woman. He could hardly ever
have been besotted enough to fancy that she had
married him for anything else than his money, but what
will not a man do to obtain the idol of his affections?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not mere blind passion that had induced
him to thrust his neck under the yoke. It might
only have been pique. He would show his nephew that
he could live very happily without his companionship,
and this was the way he showed it.</p>

<p>I mentally drew a portrait of my aunt. A dashing,
reckless girl, determined to have her own way in everything,
running up dressmakers' bills, driving about in
her carriage to spend her days in visiting and frivolity.
Ambitious of pleasing every man but her husband.
Dragging her poor old wooden-legged spouse after her
to balls, operas, and concerts, or else leaving him at
home, perhaps poorly, whilst she was enjoying herself
in some crowded assembly, surrounded by a troop of
young gallants, encouraging their attentions and making
game of the poor old fool she had cajoled into marrying
her. I imagined her pretty, witty, vivacious and with a
temper. A thorough incapacity for the management of
a household, vain, extravagant, frivolous, heartless,
calculating.</p>

<p>Such was the mental picture I had drawn of my
young aunt. How I could imagine her of an evening&mdash;if
she ever stayed at home with her husband in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
evening&mdash;yawning over the admiral's long nautical
stories, sighing and pouting when he asked her to bring
him his slippers, or rather his slipper, for he had but
one. Turning up her nose as she mixed his grog for
him or lighted his pipe. Shuddering when the old man
caressingly touched her dimpled chin, and pleading
fatigue that she might go to bed early to be alone and
dream of some handsome young lieutenant she had met
at Mrs. So-and-So's ball.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said I to myself, "I will not triumph
too long over your fall, uncle, lest some day the like
may happen to myself, which Heaven forfend."</p>

<p>I tried to imagine myself with a wife like my aunt.
I, a scholar, a searcher after the philosopher's stone,
with a gay young wife always out at parties, a family of
neglected children at home, breaking in upon my studies
and smashing my crucibles and retorts, tearing up my
valuable MSS, turning my laboratory into a nursery,
and profaning my hours of study with their crying and
squabbling.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "it shall not be. I will live single.
A scientific man is wedded to science."</p>

<p>After the letter I had received from my friend
Langton, the opinion I had formed of womankind was
somewhat of the lowest. I imagined that all women
were alike, and the dread I felt lest I should fall into a
trap myself, induced me to shut myself up more than
ever. I built a laboratory and fitted it up. I pored
over my books, fasted, slept little, and sought as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
as possible to reduce matter into mind. I resolved to
give myself wholly up to the study of the transmutation
of metals, nothing doubting that some day if I persisted
in my labours I should be rewarded by the discovery of
the philosopher's stone. I paid no visits, neither
received any. I had seen enough of dissipation, and
was now resolved to make up for lost time. A sudden
change had come over me. I was no longer the
"flotter bursch" that the year before swaggered, booted
and spurred through the streets of Jena, foremost in the
midnight revel, dauntless at the duel, guilty of every
species of extravagance and excess. I had become the
haggard and emaciated student of the dark arts, nervous
in the extreme, shunning company, and the nature of
whose studies was a mystery to all. Slovenly and
smoke begrimed, daily and nightly I poured over my
crucibles, trying all sorts of experiments and suffering
many disappointments, denying myself the common
necessaries of life, that I might expend my small income
in instruments and articles wherewith to pursue my
science. Absorbed in that one pursuit, I quite forgot
the world without, forgot that I was of the same clay as
my fellow mortals, lost all sympathy for the rest of my
kind, neither sought any from them. My whole mental
energies were concentrated on that one topic&mdash;that of
making gold. Nor was it avarice that induced me to
make gold the object of my pursuit. Nothing, I assure
you, but the pure love of science prompted me in my
studies. I had already made several curious discoveries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
I was on the eve, or thought I was, of
discovering the great secret, when owing to excessive fasting
and want of sleep, my health broke down. Being
originally of an iron constitution, I deemed in the pride
of my youth that I was proof against any fatigue of
mind or body until actual experience taught me that
there were bounds even to my powers of endurance.</p>

<p>As I had not for a very considerable time to set foot
beyond the narrow walls of my cell, and my mental
faculties were thoroughly engrossed with study, my
system required but slight stimulant. A cup of milk
and a roll in the morning and a leek in the evening was
all I required to keep soul and body together. Nay,
latterly I confined myself to a slice of bread and a glass
of water, and this lasted me all day for more than a
fortnight. This scanty food was brought me by an
orphan boy, who was deaf and dumb, whom I had
engaged as my servant, as being better able to keep
silence as to the nature of my studies.</p>

<p>Each day I fancied brought me nearer and nearer
towards the discovery of the grand secret, when Nature,
long trampled upon, rebelled, and positively refused to
hold out any longer. My form was reduced to that of a
skeleton, objects swam before my eyes, my brain reeled,
and I repeatedly fainted for want of nourishment. My
hand trembled, my mind lost its energy, and I was no
longer fit for study. I found that I had overtaxed my
strength, and saw the necessity of taking more food.</p>

<p>One morning when I felt so debilitated that I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
thought my last hour was come, I ordered my servant
to make me some broth. He had scarcely left my
laboratory to obey my orders when a peculiar sensation
came over me. I am as certain as I am of my own
existence at the present moment that I was then in a
waking state, though what I am about to relate to you
now may appear to some like a dream. I felt&mdash;if I
may so describe my feelings&mdash;that I did not belong to
myself, or, as if my spirit were entirely free and independent
of my body. It was a feeling as of a bounding elasticity,
as if neither the walls of my cell nor any other
material objects were impediments to me, and that I
was capable at will of soaring into realms of space, and
of conversing with intelligences of an immeasurably
higher order than those of our mundane sphere, and of
perfectly understanding discourses that in the body I
was perfectly sure would be beyond my comprehension.</p>

<p>I remember that on this very morning I was seated
in a high-backed arm-chair of carved oak, in a reflective
mood. My crucibles and retorts strewed the laboratory
in the greatest disorder. I was too weak to study or
even to rise from my chair, when suddenly upon raising
my eyes towards the opposite wall of my laboratory, the
scene seemed changed, and instead of the bare wall
before me I saw the mouth of a large cave, through the
innumerable arches of which I could see to a great
distance, for the interior seemed lighted up as with
fire.</p>

<p>Now, I know that I was perfectly unable to rise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
my chair, yet it appeared to me that I rose, and with
firm step entered the cave.</p>

<p>It was dark and very chilly. I gazed around me for
a moment and shuddered when I discovered at my side,
my eyes being now accustomed to the light, the form of
an old man, bald-headed, and with snowy locks and
beard. His brow was high and his eye clear and
beaming with wisdom and benevolence. His form was
upright and his step firm, and he wore a tunic with
ample folds and of a sad colour.</p>

<p>At first I started and looked at him wonderingly, as
if to ask him who he was. He answered to my thoughts
affably. "I am your guide. You have courted our
intimacy, and sought to become our equal. Come with
me, and I will initiate you into our mysteries and show
you the lot for which you have so long been striving."</p>

<p>There was something so inviting in the old man's
manner, something so charming in the calm and
dignified look that superior intellect invariably gives,
that I could not but comply, and following my guide, I
was conducted through long labyrinths of arches in
silence, until I reached the centre of the cavern, when I
found myself in a vast hall formed by nature, or roughly
hewn out of the natural rock, and illuminated by torches.</p>

<p>Here I saw a number of tables, and at each table
sat one man. They appeared to be all engaged in
chemistry, for each man had before him his crucibles
and other instruments. So absorbed did they all seem
in their work that not one of them noticed our entrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
although we were talking loud enough for all to hear
and our voices re-echoed through the cavern.</p>

<p>I tried to catch the eye of some of them in order to
salute them, and perhaps to enter into conversation with
them, but no one looked up.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat chilled at this reception, as it
seemed to me that they must have heard us, and purposely
avoided looking up. My guide, who could read
all that was passing in my mind, responded to my
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Be not grieved at their apparent want of civility,
for they do not even see you. These spirits see nothing
and hear nothing but what is immediately before them
and connected with their pursuits. All you see here are
alchemists. In your terrestrial globe their sole delight
was in the endeavour to make gold. To this end they
voluntarily imprisoned their spirits in one channel in
order to concentrate the force of their intellects towards
the object of their pursuit.</p>

<p>"The development of their intellects alone at the
expense of everything else that is human, was their
desire in the world; their intellects alone, therefore,
after death remain engrossed in their one pursuit to all
eternity, and they are both deaf and blind to all else."</p>

<p>"And will this be my lot?" I asked of my guide.</p>

<p>"That depends upon yourself," was the reply.
"Your spirit is not so entirely separated from your body
as to make your doom irrevocable. In whatever state
you quit the world of the body, in that state the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
remains to eternity. If the state of these spirits pleases
you not, there is time to set your affections on another.</p>

<p>"Anon I will show you another class of alchemists.
These that you have seen are spirits who strive to make
gold from love of science. Those I will show you now
are those who have the love of gold for their aim, to
which they make science subservient."</p>

<p>My guide then conducted me through a long dark
corridor of arches until we reached another hall lighted
up in a similar manner to the first. Here were a
number of spirits, each likewise occupied with his own
crucibles and apparatus, and paying no attention to
those around him. The hall and the instruments used
by the spirits of this second hall differed little from those
of hall the first, but the faces of the men were different.</p>

<p>In the second hall the faces were less dignified and
the skulls were broader, each of them having a preternatural
protuberance like an egg at the temples, whilst
the crown of their heads was flat. The heads of those
of the first hall were higher, and their bearing more
philosophic.</p>

<p>"I do not like the faces of those men," said I to my
guide. "I dislike the expression of greed depicted on
their countenances. Remove me from hence."</p>

<p>"I will now show you another order of spirits, also
alchemists in their way, since gold is their pursuit," and
here he led me down a dark subterranean staircase,
damp and cold, which I descended with difficulty on
account of the slipperiness of the steps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is no place for you," said my guide, "as I
observe by your cautious footsteps, yet many are they
whose haste to enter at yon door makes them rush
down head foremost, regardless of the slime, and at the
risk of breaking their necks."</p>

<p>By this time the hand of my guide was on the door,
which he entered, leading me after him. I immediately
found myself within a large and elegant hall, lighted up
with the light of day, with columns and pavement of
marble. Here was a crowd of men divided into groups,
and discussing business. Others hurrying and bustling,
jostling each other in their haste, as they traversed the
hall. The physiognomy of these men was decidedly
material. Sharp and shrewd many of them, but for the
most part of that cold, stolid, matter of fact sort that
defies you to read beyond the surface.</p>

<p>As business and business men had little charm for
me, my scrutiny of the spirits in this hall was less
minute than my observation of the spirits in the two
previous halls, and my guide, observing an expression of
weariness in my countenance, said:</p>

<p>"I see these spirits interest you not. These are
merchants, and men of business, who have made the
acquisition of gold their chief delight in the world,
without using it merely as a means to an end; but let
us pass on."</p>

<p>We then entered a hall adjoining. Here was to be
seen a long table, at which numbers were gambling.
The faces of some of these were truly hideous; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
merely simple. It was easy with half an eye to discern
the dupe and the sharper. Faces indicative of the most
sordid avarice jostled others of trusting simplicity. I
saw to what class these spirits belonged, and, sickened
at the sight, my guide led me by the hand and withdrew
me from the hall.</p>

<p>On leaving the gamblers we next found ourselves in
a beautiful garden with terraces, fountains, beds of the
choicest flowers, with a sunny landscape beyond. In
the centre of a velvet lawn was a motley group of
dancers, singers, and players on musical instruments.
The dancers were of both sexes, and many of them fair
to view. They seemed to whirl round in the giddy
dance with true delight.</p>

<p>"These, at least," I said, "are happy. How they
seem to enjoy themselves! Who would not be happy
in the midst of such a beautiful scene?"</p>

<p>"These, my friend, are but deceptive joys," replied
the sage, with a sigh. "These, you see, are those who
in the world have made pleasure the sole aim and
object of their lives, and who, on entering the world of
spirits, still retain their former tastes."</p>

<p>I watched the group of dancers for a time; at first
with pleasure, then with indifference, and lastly with a
feeling akin to disgust mingled with pity. Dancing
and merry-making is all very well as an interlude to
hard work, and doubtless did good both to mind and
body, but when I reflected that this trivial amusement
had been the sole occupation of their lives in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and would continue to be so to all eternity, I turned
away with a sigh. The whole scene seemed to me less
beautiful than before, though I could not observe that
any change had taken place in the landscape, and an
intense feeling of weariness came over me, with an
inclination to yawn, which my guide observing, said:</p>

<p>"So you have soon become disenchanted with your
realms of delight."</p>

<p>"You are right," said I; "lead me from the scene."
Turning my back on the dancers, I followed the old
man, who led me over hill, down dale, through thicket
and bramble, discoursing all the while the states of
various classes of spirits after death, till we reached a
thick forest of old gnarled trees. Flanking the forest
ran a river of molten gold. I stood upon the edge of a
rock and looked down upon the river. Here I descried
a number of naked forms of both sexes bathing in the
stream and splashing each other with the liquid metal.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" I asked.</p>

<p>"These," said my guide, "are those who in the
world found gold without seeking it, and possessing it in
abundance, knew not how to make use of it. Their sole
delight was in wasting it. The same passion remains
with them after death."</p>

<p>I fell into a reverie.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," thought I, "that these people have
nothing at all to do with their money? Could they be
in ignorance of the poverty that surrounded them whilst
in the world? Even if they were selfish and did no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
good to the rest of their kind, is it possible that they
had no private way of enjoying their worldly goods?"</p>

<p>"The spirits here in the world wasted their fortunes,
but the ruin of one fortune is the foundation of others,
as you will see anon," said the sage.</p>

<p>He then pointed out to me some men, miserable
looking and wretchedly clad, who were crawling on
their hands and knees in search of nuggets of gold that
the wanton bathers had thrown in a liquid state on to
the shore, where it had cooled. Each of these wretched
men had a bag which he filled with lumps of the yellow
metal, and when it was full, carried it on his shoulders,
tottering under its weight, till he reached his home.</p>

<p>"Neither do these men know the use of gold," said
my guide, "for they are misers, and their sole delight
is to collect gold and to worship it, without doing good
to themselves or others."</p>

<p>My curiosity was roused at this strange sight, and I
followed these men with my eyes, as a wide plain
stretched itself out, and I being on elevated ground,
could see to a great distance, for I wished to see how
far they could stagger under their enormous weight.
No dwellings appeared near at hand, and yet I was
surprised to notice that one after the other these men
suddenly disappeared. Many of them had started about
the same time laden with their sacks of gold, and not
one of the many was visible to me now on that broad
open plain. Where could they have all gone?</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said my companion, answering as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
usual to my thoughts. "These spirits, fearing lest their
houses should be broken into and pillaged, burrow under
the ground, where they can keep their riches in security.
They seldom show themselves in the daytime, but come
out of their holes at night like the owl in search of
plunder. In the world they lived by stealing, cheating,
and getting money under false pretences, and this is their
lot after death. Their subterranean dwellings are paved
and lined with gold, yet they are always wretched, for
they know no other delight than to amass gold for its
own sake."</p>

<p>I grew melancholy as I reflected on the lot of these
men.</p>

<p>"At least my lot will not be with them," I said to
myself. "I hope it cannot be said of me that I worship
gold. If I have made the converting of other metals
into gold the study of my life, it was not for the sake of
the yellow metal, but from the pure love of science like
those philosophers of the first halls."</p>

<p>"True," said my friend, in reply to my meditations,
"and yet methinks their lot pleased you but little. The
study of science for the sake of science and without
other object, is little better than the grubbing of gold for
the sake of gold. Think you not that a man's life ought
to have a little higher aim?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I, "that our studies may be useful
to others, that our discoveries may benefit mankind
to the end, that we may become more civilised, more
intellectual, more virtuous, more moral."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"If then," replied the sage, "you admit this to be
the true end of the life of man, why do you persist in
following the one study of converting baser metals into
gold, which, if the secret is once made known, could not
be of the slightest service to mankind at large, whilst
you would only reap the selfish and vain satisfaction of
having discovered the secret, whereas the precious time
that has been wasted in this useless study would have
been better employed in experiments that might tend to
discoveries beneficial to the whole human race."</p>

<p>The argument of my venerable guide made a deep
impression on me, and I reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," thought I, "that all my life has
been a mistake. Have I mistaken mere vain and selfish
ambition for that pure love of science that dignifies and
elevates the human mind? No," I answered to myself,
"not exactly; and yet I have been mistaken in studying
alchemy; for surely we ought to consider the end of
whatever study we pursue, which end ought to be in
some way or other useful to mankind at large. Now,
supposing, after having wasted the energies of a lifetime
in pursuit of the philosopher's stone, I had at length discovered
the secret, it could only benefit myself, and my
aim after all was no higher than that of those wretched
spirits whose lot I shrank from. You are right, O sage.
I will no longer waste my time and health in a fruitless
study, but henceforth devote myself to something that
may benefit my fellow creatures."</p>

<p>"You are fast growing wise," said the sage, replying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
to my thoughts; "keep to that resolution, and the
comfort you will experience from the consciousness
that you have devoted your life to the welfare of your
race will be the true alchemy, for it will be spiritual
gold."</p>

<p>My heart yearned towards the kind old man at these
words, and in an ecstasy of affection and reverence as
well as joy at having discovered the error of my life, I
embraced him, begged him never to leave me, but be
ever with me&mdash;to guide me in wisdom; to be, in fact, a
father to me, and I would follow his counsel as a son.</p>

<p>The kindly sage smiled benevolently on me, and
replied:</p>

<p>"My son, our lots are different; at least, for the
present. Recollect that you are yet in the body, whilst
I have for many ages back been all spirit. We must
shortly part; you will return to the body until you are
called from thence, whilst I must hasten to the society
of spirits to which I belong. Till then, however, I will
be your guide, and give you what instruction I may in
spiritual things."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and expressed my regret at having to
part from him so soon, and hoped we should meet again
when our conditions became the same. I then begged
him as my time was short, to show me the lot of spirits
of a higher order, saying:</p>

<p>"You have shown me those who have sought gold
from the love of science and those who have sought it
from greed. Also those who, having gold, knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
how to use it. Now show me the lot of those who,
born wealthy, have made the best use of their wealth."</p>

<p>"My son," said the sage, "those spirits are few in
number and belong to a higher sphere. One direct
from earth as yourself enters with difficulty within that
holy region. However, follow me."</p>

<p>Then there appeared to rise from the ground a sort
of mist, which thickened until it became a small but
dense cloud. Upon this my guide alighted, leading me
after him. We both of us trod the cloud beneath our
feet, upon which we made no more impression than if
our bodies had been made of the same ephemeral substance
as the vapour we trod. The cloud then commenced
to rise, and slowly wafted us high in air,
carrying us over trees and mountains as we discoursed
together by the way. Moving upwards, yet not straight
and suddenly, but describing wide circles in the air, as if
we were ascending a winding staircase, we found ourselves,
after a time, in the midst of a large dense cloud,
and our motion ceased.</p>

<p>By degrees the mist seemed to clear away, and I
beheld a curious phenomenon. I stood firmly, as if
upon the solid earth, yet when I looked above me the
earth appeared over my head, whilst the sky seemed
under my feet.</p>

<p>"What is the reason," I asked, "that in this planet
or aerial dwelling of spirits, the laws of nature are
reversed?"</p>

<p>"Your vision only is reversed," replied my guide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
"because not being as yet entirely freed from the body,
your spirit savours too much of clay to be in harmony
with the spirits of this sphere. Everything in the
spiritual world is a type, and has a hidden meaning.
As the sky is a type of heaven, so the earth we tread is
a type of material things. The reason you see the earth
above your head and the sky beneath your feet, is that
you as yet place material things above spiritual things.
It is difficult for you, as a mortal, to do otherwise, and
therefore your vision is distorted. I can, however,
while I am with you, communicate a portion of my
being to you, sufficient for you to see objects as they
really are."</p>

<p>He then touched my forehead, grasping my temples
between his finger and thumb, when a new sensation
came over me. It seemed as if I had been suddenly
lifted with the rapidity of lightning a mile or two higher
in the air, although my guide assured me that I had
never moved from the spot I was standing on. I
appeared to breathe more freely, and experienced a
most exhilarating feeling of buoyancy, with an intense
and boundless expansion of mind.</p>

<p>The sky was now above my head and the earth
beneath my feet, as in our world. I found myself surrounded
by a beautiful landscape that would baffle all
my descriptive powers to give any adequate idea of.
Trees, beautiful and curious, bearing fruit of gold, silver,
or precious stones, and of ferns that I had never seen
in the world. Hills and valleys of rich luxuriance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
crags, waterfalls, lakes with islands, magnificent palaces
of the purest white marble in a style of architecture
truly sublime. Human forms, surpassingly beautiful, of
both sexes and of all ages crossed me at intervals, from
blooming and laughing infancy to hoary but hale old
age, each stage of life bearing a marked beauty of its
own. Everyone seemed happy, and no one idle,
although the occupations of some were of a quiet,
meditative sort.</p>

<p>Philosophers discussed theories among themselves
or taught wisdom to the young, who listened attentively.
Children romped or indulged in amusements suitable
to their age. Lovers passed and repassed, discussing
together in earnest whisper. Here and there a solitary
poet composed an ode or landscape painter plied his
art. The more I gazed on the scene, the more I
became enraptured, for all was sunshine and content.</p>

<p>"How different," thought I, "is this to those false
delusive joys that I have just witnessed in the lower
world of spirits, and which I, in my besotted ignorance,
mistook for a paradise!"</p>

<p>Then my guide turning towards me said:</p>

<p>"I perceive that you are enchanted with this scene,
that the beauty around you surpasses your wildest
imagination, and that you could never desire a paradise
more delightful. These are those who in the world
were born rich, or, at least, if not rich, used the little
they possessed to relieve or promote the happiness and
welfare of their kind, denying themselves luxuries or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
even necessities in order to enlarge the field of their
charity, counting the dead pleasures of wealth as nothing
in comparison with the satisfaction they derived from
rendering happy their poorer neighbours. These are
the angels of the lowest heaven, but there are higher
joys than these, which neither you nor I may ever be permitted
to witness."</p>

<p>So enraptured was I with all around me, that I
hardly listened to the words of my guide. I yearned to
converse with some of the inhabitants of this paradise,
but a feeling of shyness, owing to a consciousness of
inferiority, held me back.</p>

<p>The inhabitants even invited me to discourse with
them, for they looked on me kindly, as if waiting for
me to address them. Maidens of most heavenly beauty
gazed upon me with sweet looks of chaste innocence.
Lovely children seemed about to seize me by the hand
to lead me away to play, but on approaching nearer to
me and perceiving that I was not of their heaven,
scampered off half-terrified. One or two hospitable
persons came forward and offered to take me into their
houses, and to show me some of the public buildings,
but my guide observing that a giddiness had seized me,
owing to the excess of delight I experienced in things so
new to me, explained to them that I was yet a mortal
only temporarily withdrawn from the body, and that a
longer stay in this region might prove dangerous to me,
as he had been commissioned to let me return shortly.
My conductor then waved his hand courteously to everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
by way of farewell, the good spirits also returning
the salute while we descended more rapidly than we had
ascended, and all around me became as before, a thick
cloud. I felt nigh fainting with a singing in my ears,
but this vanished by degrees the farther I left the
paradise behind.</p>

<p>At length my senses being sufficiently recovered, I
gazed around me; all was mist still, but every now and
then I observed certain curious phenomena, visions
which appeared and disappeared. Sometimes it was a
garden or a building, sometimes an animal, a solitary tree
or flowers. I heard strains of music, voices, laughter.
Sometimes a rose or other flower fell at my feet, and
immediately vanished; sometimes a toad or other
reptile fell near me, and likewise vanished. Sometimes
birds of prey or fierce animals were seen striving with
one another. Then again, fragments of distant landscape
appeared and vanished.</p>

<p>None of these apparitions lasted beyond a few seconds.</p>

<p>Then turning to my guide, I said:</p>

<p>"Tell me, O sage, what is the meaning of all these
appearances?"</p>

<p>To which the old man replied:</p>

<p>"These are all signs and symbols of things which in
your world have no visible nor tangible existence, their
essence being purely spiritual, yet which, nevertheless,
in their own atmosphere&mdash;the spiritual world&mdash;have a
visible existence of their own. These are the thoughts
of mortals yet living in your world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are fast approaching your earth, and therefore
these appearances become visible. The more beautiful
of these visions, such as the flowers, landscape, and singing
birds, are the representations of the pure thoughts
and desires of the good; those of the less pleasing sort,
such as the toads, adders, serpents, bats and owls,
signify the evil thoughts of the wicked, and correspond
to revenge, hatred, lust, murder, fraud, and the
like.</p>

<p>"Where these wild beasts and reptiles appear in great
numbers in the spirit world, and are seen combatting
one with the other, it is a sign of war on earth."</p>

<p>"But tell me why," I said, "I hear the sound of
music yet see no musicians, and hear the sound of
voices yet see no one?"</p>

<p>Then my companion answered me: "The murky
atmosphere through which we are now passing is also
an inhabited world. The spirits of this world are
invisible to you because you are not altogether freed
from the material veil which obscures your vision, and
that veil thickens the nearer you approach earth. The
thoughts of mortals become visible to you here because
you yourself are a mortal, but the thoughts of the purest
mortal on your earth cannot arrive at the same pitch of
sublimity as the thoughts of the meanest of disembodied
spirits of this world, and therefore the spirits themselves
are invisible to you, although they are far inferior to
those you have just visited."</p>

<p>"Then why could I enter the angels' lower paradise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
and yet am not able to see these inferior spirits?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Because," replied my instructor, "your spirit then
received sufficient light from contact with mine to enable
you to see them. I could also let you see these, but
why desire to see the lot of ordinary spirits after having
seen those of so far higher an order? It might remove
the impression, which I presume you wish to retain.
Besides our time is short, for we are near touching
earth."</p>

<p>"True, true," I said hurriedly, for another vision
suddenly arrested my attention. "Tell me, O my guide,
what is the meaning of yon strange sight?" And
strange sight it was indeed! For it was the vision of a
human leg clad in the knee-breeches of our time, and
walking about by itself.</p>

<p>"That," replied my preceptor, "is a portion of the
body of some spirit not as yet freed from clay, and for
that reason it is made visible to you. Our spirits on
first leaving the material world are an exact counterpart
of our terrestrial bodies, being an essence filling every
part and particle of our earthly frames, from which they
receive their stamp. The body itself does not rise again
as some of your world vulgarly believed, but the spiritual
body its counterpart, while the earthly covering but contributes
its dust to your globe's surface."</p>

<p>"Then the vision I see is a portion of a human soul
about to leave its earthy tenement?" asked I.</p>

<p>"By no means," replied the sage. "The owner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
that limb has yet some years of material life before him,
although, I observe, he is aged. The reason that you
see but the leg and not the rest of the body, is that that
portion of the physical body is wanting. You cannot
perceive his corporeal body because you are now in the
spirit, and the spirit can only see that which is spiritual,
as likewise the material eye only that which is material.
You are sufficiently spiritual to see spirits who are yet
encumbered with clay, but not enough so to see spirits
perfectly disembodied. On the other hand, being withdrawn
from the body, you are not yet sufficiently
material to descry material bodies."</p>

<p>"Then in fact," I observed, "the vision that I see
before me is the spirit leg of someone who in my world
has lost his material leg?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so," the sage replied, "for mortals live in
two worlds at the same time; in the material world as
to their bodies, in the spiritual world as to their spirits.
I should imagine," added he, regarding the vision
fixedly, "from the way in which it seems to approach
you that it belonged to some friend or relation of yours.
Have you no relation in the world who has lost a leg?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"A relation who has lost a leg?" I exclaimed,
for instantly my uncle, the admiral, flashed across my
mind.</p>

<p>"Exactly so, your uncle, the admiral," he replied,
reading my thoughts.</p>

<p>There was an individuality about the limb that from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the beginning seemed familiar to me. It was a right
leg, too, the very leg that my uncle had lost. There
could be no mistake about it.</p>

<p>Then said I to my guide, "I recognise the leg, sure
enough, but is its appearance now a sign that he is near
me in the body?"</p>

<p>"If not so, at least in thought," responded the sage.</p>

<p>By this time my companion told me that we had
already arrived on earth, and said that he must now
leave me, so we embraced, and he vanished from my
sight. Then the mist around me suddenly cleared
away, and I was surprised to find myself once again in
my laboratory, seated in the same old carved arm-chair,
and surrounded by several persons.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, amongst those persons I instantly
recognised a face long familiar to me. It was my
uncle's!</p>

<p>Poor old man! He had dreadfully changed. His
iron grey hair had become perfectly white, his black
eyebrows "a sable silvered." He stooped very much,
and the muscles of his face were drooping and flaccid,
while his ruby nose had lost its fine rich colour and
faded into a sickly ashen hue. The individual next
to him I recognised at once as our common friend, Mr.
Langton. Then I saw a strange face which I concluded
must be the doctor. There was also my deaf and
dumb boy, who had not long brought up my basin of
broth, as it was still steaming, and he was awaiting my
recovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>Little more remains to be told. My poor uncle, as
our friend Langton had prophesied, had been obliged
to sue for a divorce, shortly after which his worthless
partner eloped with a paramour. The whole sad
occurrence preyed upon the old man's mind, and
brought on a dangerous illness, from which, however,
he recovered. During his illness he had spoken much
of his nephew, and on his recovery the doctor had
recommended him a change of scene to divert his mind.
As he had expressed a wish to see his nephew once
more before he died, his friend Langton had offered to
accompany him. The doctor also formed one of the
party, and they had travelled together to Jena as an
agreeable surprise for me.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that all former differences were
forgotten, and that my old uncle resolved never to make
a fool of himself again. He even encouraged his
nephew's studies, and gave his sanction at length that
my friend the chemist's son should join me in my
studies. My health rapidly improved under careful
treatment, and I never saw any more visions. I quite
gave up alchemy, and applied myself to other branches
of chemistry. Nevertheless, my studies had not been
quite useless, as in my search after the philosopher's
stone, I had made several very curious discoveries in
science, and my name soon became famous throughout
the university.</p>

<p>My uncle's illness had wrought as great a change
morally as it had done physically in him. His nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was completely changed. His treatment of me was
now of the kindest. He seemed even to respect me for
the perseverance I had shown in my studies and to be
ashamed of his former narrow-minded notions. He
remained with me at Jena until his health and my
health had completely recovered, when I accompanied
him to England, where I once more saw my friend, the
chemist's son, whom I subsequently took out with me
to Jena, where we pursued our studies together for some
three years, after which we both returned to England,
where I took up my quarters at my uncle's house.</p>

<p>The admiral lived a good ten years after his illness,
and died at the good old age of ninety, leaving to me
his entire fortune.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>An Interlude.</h3>

<p>On the conclusion of Mr. Crucible's narrative that
gentleman was highly complimented on his tale by each
member of the club in turn, especially by Mr. Oldstone.
Our worthy host, owing to a strong potation he had
imbibed before the commencement of the recital, more
than once manifested symptoms of dropping into the
arms of Morpheus, but was prevented from doing so
each time by the opportune administration of sundry
pinches of snuff from Mr. Oldstone's snuff-box.</p>

<p>If there was one thing this gentleman never forgave,
it was a man going to sleep in the middle of a good
story; he, therefore, as soon as the narrator had
finished, felt it his solemn duty to remonstrate with our
host severely upon his want of good breeding, to which
the worthy man replied in a humble apology to all the
company. As for his daughter Helen, she was attention
itself throughout, and with the exception of Mr. Oldstone,
was the loudest in praise of Mr. Crucible's recital.</p>

<p>"Well, Helen," said one of the members, "what do
you think of the last story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am delighted with it," exclaimed the girl in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
ecstasy. "How I wish it had happened to me! I
should so like to have a vision of that sort."</p>

<p>"Would you my dear?" said Mr. Crucible, "then I
hope that if ever you see the Paradise I saw that you
may remain there, for there you belong. You are too
good for this earth."</p>

<p>"Now then, Crucible, none of your nonsense," said
Mr. Oldstone. "Is that the way you talk to young
ladies? I'm surprised at you. Look how you have
made the poor girl blush."</p>

<p>"Don't be jealous, old boy," retorted the last
narrator, "but give us another story. This is your turn."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried several voices at once. "Mr.
Oldstone for a story! Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>"Really, gentlemen," said Mr. Oldstone, "it is so
soon after the last, and as it is now getting somewhat
late, I would fain put off my story for another time, and
spend the evening between this and bedtime in some
other way. Suppose we all fill our glasses. Perhaps
someone may recollect a song."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cried all the guests at once, "but who's
to be the songster?"</p>

<p>"Can't you favour us, Helen?" asked Mr. Parnassus.</p>

<p>Helen declared that she could not sing, that she did
not know any songs.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Helen, that's all nonsense," said the
doctor, "I've heard your voice before now warbling
away when you thought no one was listening to you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said our host, "you are right, sir, she <i>can</i>
sing when she likes as pretty a little song as ever you'd
wish to hear, though I say it, that shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Come, Helen, don't be shy, sing away my girl,"
said Hardcase.</p>

<p>"Let us make a bargain, Helen," said McGuilp. "If
<i>you</i> will sing a song, <i>I</i> will. There, you cannot refuse."</p>

<p>The girl's face brightened up as she stole a glance
at our artist, and thus urged, began in a clear and sweet
voice the following ditty:&mdash;</p>

<h4>The Nightingale.</h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The nightingale sang to her love the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One night when the moon was shining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth was hushed in still repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But a heart with love was pining.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two lovers through the misty air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the trees were strolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gallant and a lady fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A bell in the distance tolling.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beloved, hear'st thou that distant wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sad and mournful knelling?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sweetheart, 'tis but the nightingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That her tale of love is telling."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No, no, 'tis not the nightingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I feel a dire foreboding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night spreads o'er her dusky veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our joys of love corroding."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, loved one; banish idle fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The moon is bright and beaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek not to drown thy joy in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When thy star above is gleaming."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See here this flower," (he plucked a rose),<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"How beautious is its blossom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear this for me, for it but grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To deck thy snow white bosom."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then out and shrieked the nightingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh spare, oh spare, my lover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too late!" she cries, with dismal wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the greenwood cover.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah me!" outshrieked that bird of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"My love is gone for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vengeance waits thee, cruel knight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou from thy love shalt sever."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too true, alas! the night bird's curse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For 'neath the trees did hover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An envious wight with arquebus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">T'await his rival lover.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarce had the gloomy prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Died on his ears unheeding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the foe a poisoned shaft let fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the knight fell pale and bleeding.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A lady mourns her love deceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her eyes in death are rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant tolling knell had ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But again the knell is tolling.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>"Thank you, Helen, thank you; very well sung,"
said several voices at once.</p>

<p>"It is a fanciful and mournful ditty," said Parnassus,
"but the tune is good."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, somewhat melancholy," said McGuilp.
"Have you no other, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I did but bargain for one," said the girl, smiling.</p>

<p>"True," said McGuilp, "and now you want to hear
one from me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so," said Mr. Oldstone. "Keep him to
his word, Helen. Don't let him shirk off."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. McGuilp," said several voices at once,
"we are all waiting."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," began the painter, "if you will
permit me to retire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Retire!&mdash;Oh, nonsense!" exclaimed Oldstone,
Crucible, and others simultaneously. "Why you never
mean to back out after having&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, gentlemen, nothing of the sort, I assure you,"
said our artist, "I was only going to ask leave of the
company to retire a moment to my chamber to bring
down an article indispensable to the song I am about
to sing."</p>

<p>"I believe he is going to sing in costume," said
Mr. Blackdeed, "and that he is going in search of some
'property.'"</p>

<p>"No, nor that either," said the painter. "The song
I shall sing to you this evening, gentlemen, is an ode
that I composed myself to a skull which I found among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
some ancient ruins in Rome, and out of which I have
made a drinking cup. As this is a drinking song, in
which the cup is often alluded to, it will be necessary
that the goblet itself be present."</p>

<p>"By all means," said several members.</p>

<p>"Let us see the precious relic," said the antiquary.
"These things are quite in my line."</p>

<p>"And mine too," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Our artist left the apartment and returned with the
relic, which he placed in the centre of the table for all
to admire.</p>

<p>"There, Helen," said he, "that cup was once a
man's head, who laughed, sang, and told stories, too,
I've no doubt, like the best of us."</p>

<p>"And you use it to drink out of!" exclaimed the
girl, in extreme disgust. "What a horrible idea."</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone put on his spectacles and bent over
the table attentively to examine it. Dr. Bleedem took
it up, tapped it, looked at it all over, and declared that
it was different in form to the skulls of the present day,
observing that it was evidently of great antiquity, as the
enamel had worn away. The bone, he said, was of great
thickness.</p>

<p>The object of general curiosity was handed round
the table from one to the other. At length Mr.
Blackdeed took it up, and striking into a Hamlet-like
attitude, quoted at full length the well-known passage:</p>

<p>"'Alas! poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a
fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy,' etc., etc."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Applause followed the quotation.</p>

<p>"The song! the song!" cried others, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Composed by himself; mark that, gentlemen," said
Mr. Parnassus. "A brother poet! Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>The company then drew themselves eagerly round
the table, while our artist filled the human goblet to the
brim, and after taking a sip from it, stood up, and
holding it aloft, sang in a clear rich voice the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<h4>Lines to a Skull.</h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the end of our artist's song he was unanimously
cheered by the members of the club, and highly complimented
upon his poetical skill, especially by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Parnassus, who voted that he should be crowned with
laurel. Mr. Oldstone eagerly seconded the proposal,
but McGuilp modestly declined the honour. However,
our worthy host, Jack Hearty, was sent out once more
in the snow to gather laurel for the brow of the new
poet laureate, in spite of our artist's modest protestations.
He returned shortly afterwards with a branch
of laurel, off which he first shook the snow, and then
deposited upon the table. Mr. Oldstone quickly converted
it into a wreath, and decreed it should be placed
upon the songster's head by the fair hands of the pretty
Helen. The decree was greeted with cheers, and Helen,
blushing deeply and smiling, placed it on the head of
the newly-discovered poet, our artist receiving it on
bended knee amid the cheering of the club. McGuilp
having risen from his knees, took his seat again at the
table by the side of our host's pretty daughter, then
rising to his feet and raising the skull aloft, he proposed
the following toast in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I propose the health of the 'Wonder
Club,' and that of our worthy host and his fair
daughter, our guest, to be drunk by every member
present solemnly and devoutly from this goblet."</p>

<p>More cheering, during which McGuilp took a sip at
the funereal chalice, and then passed it on to his
neighbour, who did the same, each member in his turn
sipping and nodding round to the rest.</p>

<p>When the skull had been the round of the table,
it was then passed on to our host, who hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that the company would excuse him, but that
his lips had never yet been contaminated by
dead men's bones, and he hoped they never would
be.</p>

<p>Persuasions and remonstrances from the members
were alike vain, for neither our host nor his daughter
could be persuaded to touch the sacrilegious relic.</p>

<p>In order not to give offence to the company, our
host proclaimed his willingness to drink the toast out of
a clean glass. This was at length agreed to, and the
worthy man rose, and in a short bluff speech, thanked
the company present for having drunk his health and
that of his daughter. A clapping of hands followed
our host's speech, and then Mr. Crucible, being the
eldest member, returned thanks on the part of the
club.</p>

<p>At that moment the hooting of an owl was heard
outside. Helen turned pale, and instinctively drew
nearer to our artist.</p>

<p>"Why, Helen my girl!" cried the doctor, "how
pale you are. What are you frightened at?"</p>

<p>"Do you not hear?" said the girl. "It is the cry of
the owl; they say it is a sign of death in the house."</p>

<p>"Come, Helen," said Hardcase, "you must not be
superstitious; those things are all nonsense."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can assure you&mdash;&mdash;" began the girl,
when Mr. Oldstone broke in.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Poet Laureate, look how your fair companion
trembles at your side. Cannot you think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
some lay that might cheer her spirits and dispel her
fears? Just try."</p>

<p>"Well," answered he of the laurel crown, "talking
about owls, I once kept a pet owl myself, that I
captured one night in a nook under the arches of the
Colosseum. He was a great favourite of mine, and used
to perch on the top of my easel when I was at work,
and watch every movement I made. I composed an
ode to him. If you would like to hear it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, by all means," promptly answered Oldstone.</p>

<p>"In that case, Jack," said McGuilp, addressing our
host, "you will oblige me by getting my mandoline. I
mean that musical instrument that you will find in the
corner of my room upstairs, just by way of accompaniment."</p>

<p>Jack Hearty left the room, and returned soon with
the instrument.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we shall hear some music," said Oldstone
rubbing his hands, and by this time Helen seemed to
have forgotten her fears, and her eyes glistened in
anticipation.</p>

<p>Our artist then ran his fingers lightly over the
instrument by way of prelude and began the following
ditty.</p>

<p>Immense applause greeted this last ode of our
artist's, and the health of the new poet laureate was
proposed by Mr. Oldstone and drunk all round, after
which our artist returned thanks in a humorous speech
which called forth much laughter from the other
members, and much clapping of hands and rattling of
glasses ensued. Glasses were then refilled, and after a
little more pleasant conversation the party broke up for
the night and each retired to his solitary bed-chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>Lost in the Catacombs.&mdash;The Antiquary's Story.</h3>

<p>The next morning broke dull and cheerless. It had
been snowing hard all night, and was snowing still, and
so murky was the atmosphere that the club was obliged
to breakfast by candle-light, and indeed continued to
burn candles till early noon.</p>

<p>Our artist was in despair about the weather, for he
reckoned upon a long sitting from his fair model, and,
under the circumstances, painting was impossible, so he
wandered gloomily about the inn like a wild animal in
a cage. Breakfast over, a discussion arose as to what
should be the order of the day. Some voted for
cards, others felt inclined for chess, yet no one
felt a very strong longing for any one thing in particular.
It was one of those melancholy days when a man
really does not know what to do with himself. Some
yawned and stretched themselves, others gazed gloomily
out into the darkness, until someone suddenly recollected
that it was Mr. Oldstone's turn to tell a story, so
without more delay, chairs were drawn round the fire,
Jack Hearty was called for to put on a fresh log, pipes
were lit, and Mr. Oldstone forced into an arm-chair and
pressed to begin his story without further preface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Our host was invited to remain, but he excused himself
on the score of business. Helen was also called
away to help her mother in household affairs; but this,
of course, the club could not hear of, so after some
little parley, she was reluctantly permitted to keep the
club company, as one of the members observed it would
be hard indeed to deprive the club of Helen in such
weather, as her face was the only sunshine they were
likely to get all day. Helen smiled somewhat confusedly
at this broad compliment, and then accepted a
seat placed for her between McGuilp and Parnassus.</p>

<p>The company drew nearer to the fire, one of the
members giving a preliminary poke at the log, while
Oldstone, after tapping his snuff-box and taking from
its inside a copious pinch of snuff to clear his
memory, threw himself back in his easy-chair, and folding
his hands, commenced his story thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>When I was in Rome, many years ago, with my
friend and brother antiquary, Rustcoin, well-known to
most of you gentlemen, and especially to my friend Mr.
Vandyke McGuilp. We had put up together during the
early part of our stay in a large Hotel in a fashionable
quarter of the city.</p>

<p>We were both young then, and furnished with ample
means for travelling. It had been the dream of my
youth to visit the eternal city, and here I found myself,
free for the first time in my life to wander about to my
heart's content among the venerable ruins of antiquity,
the history of which had so interested me from my boyhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Being neither pushed for time nor money, having a
comfortable little income left me upon the death of my
parents, I never could make up my mind to follow any
profession in particular, and having from my youth upwards
always had a passion for antiquarian lore, I
resolved to make it the study of my life. Rustcoin was
similarly situated to myself, and we have always pulled
wonderfully together. Not a day passed but some
interesting ruin, church, or picture gallery, was explored,
a minute description of which was immediately entered
into my diary with a view to a grand arch&aelig;ological work
which I intended for the press, and which was afterwards
published.</p>

<p>We knew the Vatican by heart, St. Peters, and all
the chief churches. Had visited the Capitol, the Forum,
the Palace of the C&aelig;sars, the Colosseum, the baths of
Caracalla, of Titus, of Diocletian, the Pantheon and
other antique temples. One sight, however, I had not
yet been to see, and that was the catacombs. They
had always had, from my boyhood, a great fascination
for me, those dark, dank, mysterious subterranean
labyrinths excavated by those pious enthusiasts, the
early Christians, to shelter themselves from the persecutions
of their pagan tyrants. Little did their oppressors
imagine, I presume, when first a few straggling fanatics
assembled clandestinely under the dark arches they
had hewn for themselves out of the solid rock to carry
on their devotions undisturbed by candle-light, that
that little sect would one day fill the wide world with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
followers to the utter extinction of the old pagan
superstitions.</p>

<p>How strange is destiny! Religious faith proved too
strong for tyranny. Persecutions and martyrdoms were
of no avail, for still the faith increased. The very
victims of the faith, too, the holy martyrs magnified into
heroes after death, as if in defiance of the old creed.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, these facts are as well known to all
of you as to myself, yet such were my reflections as I
drove off one morning to visit the catacombs of Saint
Sebastian. But I anticipate. Rising one morning filled
with the idea of exploring these subterranean burial
grounds as far as they extended, though for twelve
miles those indefatigable early Christians have undermined
the eternal city, I breakfasted hurriedly, calculating
on my friend's company, but Rustcoin happened to
have business on hand that day, and could not be
persuaded to go, so I determined to start off alone.</p>

<p>A little before starting I accompanied Rustcoin
down one of the by streets to make a call, and whilst,
waiting for him to return, I amused myself by looking into
an antiquary's shop window. There were some ancient
Roman coins, some rusty Roman armour, pieces of
Etruscan pottery, antique lamps and fragments of statuary.
As I stood gazing at these curiosities for some considerable
time, the antiquary bowed me in, giving me to
understand that I was at liberty to look over the contents
of his shop without being obliged to buy. He saw
that I was an Englishman, and evidently had an eye to
business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>He showed me some fragments of Roman tombs
bearing a portion of an inscription, some bronze pans,
and other instruments used for sacrifices, some spearheads,
some ancient mosaic, etc., etc. I was soon
attracted by a plate of antique seals, and was poring
over them with a lens.</p>

<p>"Ah, signor," said the man, "I see you appreciate
these gems of art. That ring that you are looking at
now was found entire in a place underground, where the
vestal virgins used to be buried alive when convicted of
unchastity."</p>

<p>"What will you take for it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, considering that it is such a fine gem of art,
sir, I could not ask less than four hundred scudi."</p>

<p>"Four hundred scudi!" I exclaimed. "Why, that is
four thousand pauls," said I.</p>

<p>"Precisely so, signor."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said I, pretending to be more knowing
than I actually was. "I see you take me for an
Englishman. Well, if I am an Englishman, I am one
who understands the value of these things, for I have
had dealings before in things of this sort."</p>

<p>Now, I had not the slightest idea of the prices that
these articles fetched, but knowing that it was perfectly
necessary to beat down an Italian in a bargain, I took
it for granted that he had asked just double, and said,
"Come, now, without wasting time in further parley, I
will give you the half of what you ask&mdash;two hundred
scudi and not a jot more," (being 40 pounds sterling.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible, signor," said the man.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then," said I, "I wish you a good
morning," and I made towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stay, signor," said the shopman; "let us say three hundred and fifty
scudi; it is dirt cheap, and if I were
not in immediate want of money I would not let it go
at such a price."</p>

<p>"No," said I, walking out of the shop; "you know
my terms; if you agree to these, so much the better for
you, if not, <i>Addio</i>," and off I walked.</p>

<p>I had got about half way down the street when the
man ran out after me. "Signor, only three hundred
scudi; this is for the last time, think of that! It is a sin
to let such a bargain slip."</p>

<p>"No, no," said I, "not even for two hundred and
ten. I have said two hundred scudi, and I even grudge
that, yet if you will take it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not even for two hundred and ten!" repeated the
man. "O Gesu Maria!" added he, slapping his forehead.</p>

<p>"You seem anxious to get rid of it, my friend," said
I, half-quizzingly.</p>

<p>"No, signor," replied he, "I can assure you it cuts
me to the heart to part with such a gem, but I am a
poor man with a large family, and I want money, otherwise
I would not sell it for three times the amount."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you want money," said I, dryly,
"the best thing you can do is to assent to my terms,
for I shall certainly give no more."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed to reflect a little, and then with a shrug
said: "<i>Ebbene</i>, as the signor wishes; but it is a dead
loss to me; <i>you</i>, signor, are the winner, not I."</p>

<p>So I paid him the money, and walked off with the
ring on my finger the same that I wear to this day,
gentlemen. Here it is. There is no doubt that it is a
very excellent specimen of Gr&aelig;co-Roman art, and is
most elaborately cut. I have not the slightest doubt,
however, that I paid enough and more than enough for
it, for as I followed the man with my eyes, I noticed an
avaricious chuckle on his face, as an Italian shopman
may be supposed to wear at having bamboozled an
Englishman.</p>

<p>By this time my friend Rustcoin returned. I showed
him my purchase, at which he went into raptures. I
told him that I wished to visit the catacombs that
morning, and therefore could not accompany him
further. He advised me to wait till the morrow, and
that we should go together, but I had inwardly vowed
that morning that go I would, and nothing should
prevent me; so telling Rustcoin that we should meet at
dinner, I hailed a carriage and drove off to the church
of St. Sebastian.</p>

<p>It is a comparatively modern church, built upon the
site of the ancient basilisk supposed to have been
erected by Constantine, and consecrated by St. Silvester,
was renewed by the Pope San Domaso, and since repeatedly
restored, being at length rebuilt in the year
1611.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>On my arrival I found several carriages waiting outside.
I entered the church, and there was a party of
about a dozen English people, who had likewise come
to visit the catacombs.</p>

<p>I joined the party, and we descended a flight of
steps, each of us bearing in our hands a taper, or rather
tall, narrow candle. We were conducted by a lean,
emaciated monk, who looked as if he had lived upon
nothing but by inhaling the damp air of the catacombs.
As we descended, the first object shown us was a bust
of St. Sebastian by Bernini, over the tomb of the saint,
and near was an altar under which was interred the
body of St. Lucine.</p>

<p>As we walked along single file through these long
dark corridors, the roofs of which were every now and
then so low that we were obliged to stoop, we were
shown the graves of saints and martyrs who had been
entombed within the walls, every now and then arriving
at some little chapel, in the walls of which three or four
popes had been buried.</p>

<p>The place where the altar had stood was also carved
in the rock. Here we came across a tomb with an
inscription, there upon some rude drawings on the wall
by the early Christians, representing various sacred
subjects.</p>

<p>Impatient at having to stand still and listen to the
explanation of the monk who accompanied us and to
hear the questions of this knot of English people, I felt
an incontrollable impulse to strike out for myself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
some new track, not meaning to content myself with the
mere fashionable route shown to foreigners.</p>

<p>I considered that I had not come there merely to
have a peep at these subterranean vaults, for the sake of
being able to say when I returned to England that I
had seen the catacombs, but intended whilst I was about
it to investigate these mysterious haunts thoroughly
and conscientiously, for the sake of discovering, if possible,
some inscriptions or other relics worthy of note
that I might describe in my great arch&aelig;ological work,
and thus hand my name down to posterity.</p>

<p>The investigation of some unknown region, especially
if accompanied by a spice of danger, has always been
with me a passion. I longed to be able to do something
that nobody yet had done. I could not but be
aware of the danger of my resolution to explore these
dusky labyrinths without a guide, yet I prepared myself
in a measure against a contingency, carrying in my
pocket an extra roll of paper, in case that which I bore
in my hand should come to an end, and a tinder-box.</p>

<p>Besides this, I had filled my pockets with bread,
partly in case of extreme emergency, to sustain life, and
partly to drop in crumbs behind me as I went to mark
the way. I had commenced dropping my breadcrumbs
from the very beginning and making slight excursions
by myself, then turning back to join the party of
English.</p>

<p>Once or twice the monk called me back, and as I
went and returned several times, I suppose no notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
was taken when I really did strike out in an unbeaten
track. I took an opportunity of starting when a stout
English female was assailing our ascetic friend with
trivial questions in wretched Italian.</p>

<p>Whilst public attention seemed engrossed I started
off with my taper through a long and apparently interminable
passage, which I was told led to Ostia, the
ancient sea-port. No one called after me, so I suppose
I was not missed.</p>

<p>On, and still further, on I went, groping my way
until I could no longer hear the voices of the party, nor
see the light of their tapers through the dim arches of
the catacombs.</p>

<p>"Would the monk miss me and go in search of me,
thus breaking short all hopes of my exploring expedition?"
I asked myself.</p>

<p>To avoid this, or at least to see as much as possible
of the forbidden haunts before I was caught, I walked
on fast, not forgetting, however, to drop my breadcrumbs
all the time.</p>

<p>There is a great sameness in all these catacombs,
being long, straight, gloomy passages branching off in
all directions, only varied at intervals with an occasional
chapel, barely large enough to hold ten people crowded
together, a simple, roughly-hewn cell in the rock, and
destitute of anything that an antiquarian might be
tempted to pocket; however, whenever I came across
an inscription of any interest I immediately jotted it
down in my note-book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the thought of being lost in these terrible
catacombs with the prospect before me of gradually
dying of starvation without the slightest chance of
succour had often occurred to my mind, and was of all
thoughts the most dreadful.</p>

<p>It was a daring thing I was attempting, and I own
to experiencing a slight tremor, which increased the
further I advanced. Yet, what had I to fear? Was I
not well provided with tapers and tinder-box? Had I
not marked the way with breadcrumbs besides carrying
with me a good-sized roll to allay hunger in case of
emergency? What danger did I incur? So I stifled
my fears and boldly proceeded, passing innumerable
tombs of saints and martyrs, chapels, inscriptions, rude
drawings on the wall, Latin names, etc.</p>

<p>If I still felt any lingering tremor, it was a pleasing
fear that only spurred me on the more, and I had not
the slightest inclination to turn back. The situation
was a new one to me, and I experienced from it a new
emotion. Here was I, a solitary individual in the
bowels of the earth, with the gay world above me
perfectly unconscious that one of their kind was burrowing,
taper in hand, beneath their very feet, treading in
the footsteps of those enthusiastic workmen who had
excavated these vaults, and which had been untrodden
since by foot of man!</p>

<p>What will not an enthusiast go through in the noble
pursuit of science? My stock of bread was now completely
exhausted. I had not left a crumb to satisfy my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
hunger in case of need, such was my enthusiasm to
penetrate deeply into these unknown regions.</p>

<p>But what matter? When I felt hungry I could
return at any time. Had I not the clue? Thus I said
to myself as I sprinkled my last remaining crumbs
behind me. I had now penetrated a very considerable
distance into this abode of the pious dead, when here
an unforeseen and terrible accident befell me. Walking
onward and incautiously looking behind me as I proceeded,
I did not observe a flight of steep steps, slippery
from the damp slime that exudes below ground,
and that led&mdash;where? I never knew, for suddenly
losing my footing, I fell headlong down into a dark
abyss, where I lay stunned and senseless.</p>

<p>How long I remained thus it is impossible to tell,
for when I recovered my senses sufficiently to grope
around me, I could recollect nothing, but I found my
head cut and bleeding profusely. I felt the warm blood
trickling down my neck and matting my hair. I tried
to stand upon my feet, but swooned again from loss of
blood. I had just presence of mind when I awoke from
my swoon to bind up my head with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>I remained for long on the cold ground in a sitting
posture and tried to collect my ideas. Gradually I
became aware of the horror of my situation. Of course
my taper was extinguished by my fall. I essayed to
relight it, but the material was damp with the dews of
the catacomb and with my blood, besides which my
strength failed me. I began to feel hungry, too, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
had eaten but a light breakfast. Could anything have
been more pitiable than my plight? Wounded in the
head and weakened with loss of blood, lost in the very
heart of the catacombs without a light, without the
barest prospect of mortal coming to my rescue, hungry,
the little bread that I had taken with me wasted to make
a clue which I now found it impossible to trace in the
dark, and with every prospect of a lingering death before
me!</p>

<p>With difficulty I clambered up the steps and searched
in vain for the crumbs of bread on my hands and
knees. I was nigh fainting again, but that strong
love of life that is instinctive in us all made me screw up
my nerves with a preternatural energy, and I essayed to
shout for help.</p>

<p>Although I must have been aware of the futility of
my attempts, we all know that a drowning man will
cling to a straw, so bracing my strength up to its utmost
possible pitch, I gave vent to a superhuman shriek,
which re-echoed through the gloomy arches like the
mocking laugh of demons.</p>

<p>The sound of my own voice in agony amidst the
awful silence of this place of tombs sent a new thrill of
horror through my frame, my nerves being rendered
weak and sensitive by the loss of vital fluid I had sustained,
and jarred upon the full consciousness of my
terrible situation. I felt on the brink of madness.
Every now and then I heard the rumbling of carriage
wheels over my head, like distant thunder in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
above me, which enhanced still more the misery of my
position, for I could not help contrasting my lot with
that of the happy individual rolling over my head in his
proud carriage, enjoying the bright sun and blue sky
whilst I was doomed to be buried alive in those horrible
catacombs, dying by inches in the greatest conceivable
agony of body and mind, but few feet below that
carriage road over which passed the gay and thoughtless
in their fashionable equipages.</p>

<p>I tried to call out again, but my voice failed me.
"If I die," I thought, "it must not be by inches, but at
once, at a blow." I was preparing to dash my head desperately
against the wall, and thus put an end to my
misery, but lacking strength, I fell down once more
exhausted.</p>

<p>When I again awoke I felt both hungry and thirsty.
The wound in my head had ceased to bleed, but the
handkerchief was saturated. I now felt the calmness of
despair. I knew nothing short of a miracle could save
me, so I tried to reconcile myself to my condition. I
could just walk, but slowly. I tried to retrace my steps,
though at a snail's pace and without a clue.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of my condition now dawned upon
me more clearly than ever. It was impossible even to
retrace my steps alone and in the dark, especially in my
weakened state. Why should I uselessly try a thing I
knew to be impossible? Why not lie quietly down and
die? I sank helplessly on the ground and gave up all
hope. I felt that my end was not far off, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
review my past life. The errors, the follies, the crimes
during my brief existence chased each other with painful
vividness and rapidity through my memory. Not even
the most trifling incident of my childhood was forgotten,
but every event and thought of my life vividly,
exactly and distinctly, traced with indelible finger upon
the tablets of my brain, passing before my mental vision
like a vast panorama.</p>

<p>It was then that I ventured to pray, and if I never
prayed in my whole life before, I did then. Well can I
remember the agony of remorse I felt for the precious
time I had wasted. I was then five and twenty, a
quarter of a century old, and what had I yet done to
benefit my fellow creatures? and what had I not done
that lay in my power to gratify my own selfish wants?
Could I call to mind even one <i>thoroughly</i> good act?
Were not even my best actions based upon a sort of
selfishness? How I longed to live over again those five
and twenty years!</p>

<p>What resolutions did I not make to turn over a new
leaf for the future if my Creator should be pleased to
spare my young life! I prayed fervently and devoutly,
such praying as only the most intense mental agony can
prompt the soul to, until my nervous system, overcome
with excessive tension, I sank into a sort of lethargy,
something between life and death. Emerging at length
somewhat from this state, I began to meditate thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Is it possible that my young life is to be cut short in
this manner? Is this what I was born for&mdash;to perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
miserably from the ill-consequences of a foolish though
innocent freak&mdash;or will the Almighty really hear my
prayer? Have I not prayed fervently with all my heart
and soul, and has He not promised to help those who
trust in Him? I <i>will</i> trust in Him. I will <i>not</i> believe
that the age of miracles has gone by never to return.</p>

<p>Miracles are wrought daily, though we do not acknowledge
them as such. I felt a calmness and resignation
at these thoughts, and almost indifferent if the
Lord should be pleased to take my soul, or work some
miracle to save me from a lingering death. Either
way I would have been content, for I now felt prepared
to die, and had no fear of death.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to keep my faith in the mercy of my
Creator firm and unwavering. If for a moment a
slight doubt rose in my mind as to the likelihood of the
Deity working a miracle for my special benefit, it was
instantly dismissed, and I prayed more earnestly. I
<i>would</i> believe, I would <i>not</i> be robbed of my faith by the
jeering of that mocking fiend, Doubt. I persisted in
believing, and Doubt fled from me. I <i>felt</i> I should be
saved. I <i>knew</i> it.</p>

<p>While thus meditating, methought that the extreme
end of one of these long corridors had grown a trifle
lighter than it was a minute ago. Was it a mistake, and
merely the effect of my eyesight having grown accustomed
to the darkness?</p>

<p>No, for the light now grew rapidly brighter. Could
it be that the monks were coming in search of me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;no, for I now saw a solitary figure in the distance
bearing a candle, but it was not the figure of a
monk, for the garb was white, and apparently that of a
female. I held my breath in wonder and expectation,
whilst my heart thumped so loudly against my ribs that
it might have caused an echo. My eyes were steadfastly
fixed on the figure as it moved slowly towards me. It
was undoubtedly the figure of a woman clad in a long
white classic robe and a white head covering, such as
worn by the priestesses of old. The shoulders and arms
were bare, and on one arm she wore a golden armlet, on
her feet sandals. She was now sufficiently near me for
me to take a complete survey of her. Her face was pale
and dreadfully emaciated, yet there were traces of great
beauty left. She mumbled something to herself which
at first I took for Italian, but on catching a word or two
more, I had no difficulty in discovering it to be
Latin, for she repeatedly muttered to herself the word
"Peccavi," beating her breast the while. I rose to my
feet as she approached. At first she appeared not to
notice me and would have passed me. At length I
addressed her in Italian. "Signora," I began, "I have
lost my way in the dark and am suffering from an
accident; perhaps you can show me the way out of these
catacombs, for I am weak and dying of hunger."</p>

<p>The figure gazed blankly at me in silence, which I
attributed not so much to surprise as to her not understanding
the language in which I addressed her. At
length she spoke in a faint sepulchral voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Quis es tu qui in hoc loco versaris?</i>"</p>

<p>To which I replied in the same classic tongue in
which she addressed me.</p>

<p>"<i>Christianus sum, tu autem quis es?</i>" I am a
Christian, but who art thou? To which she gave the
following account of herself.</p>

<p>"<i>Virgo Vestalis sum, aut possius eram; nunc autem
nec virgo nec vestalis.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Intelligo</i>," I answered&mdash;I understand&mdash;not willing
to extort a confession that might be painful to her, but
she seemed communicative and inclined to enlighten me
further.</p>

<p>"<i>Audi!</i>" she continued, "<i>quandam eram in mundo
virum amavi. Christianus erat, et propter meum crimen
quod perpetravi cum viro hoc Christiano, ad mortem
damnata viva sepulta fui. Attaman cum ante meam
mortem fuerim ad Christifidem conversa, nunc meus
spiritus hac illuc hoc in loco versatur.</i>"</p>

<p>I expressed my deepest sympathy for her sufferings
in the best Latin I could muster, and indeed I was well
able to sympathise with her, for did not <i>I</i> feel what it
was to be buried alive and to endure the gnawing pangs
of hunger?</p>

<p>"Alas, poor ghost!" I felt inclined to say, with
Hamlet, and I could not help muttering to myself,
"How hard, alas!&mdash;just for one fault, for one piece of
human frailty, resulting from the over tenderness of a
woman's heart, to die such a horrible death."</p>

<p>"<i>An es estraneus in hoc loco?</i>" she asked me, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
overheard my soliloquy and perceiving that it was in a
foreign tongue.</p>

<p>"<i>Civis Brittanicus sum</i>," I replied, and then I began
to relate my history, my misfortunes, and how I had
prayed to be delivered from such a dreadful death,
begging her to show me the way out of these horrid
catacombs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"<i>Hac conditione</i>,"&mdash;On this condition&mdash;she said.</p>

<p>"<i>Qu&aelig;nam est?</i>" What is it? I asked.</p>

<p>She replied thus: "<i>Annulus quem in digito geris
quem quidem circiter quinque Sestertia valet et meus erat
nom habui a viro quem delexi vende ad levandum meum
spiritum.</i>"</p>

<p>Here was a surprise! The ring that I had purchased
previously to starting off for the catacombs belonged
and had been worn by the spirit before me when in the
flesh! The man of whom I bought it spoke the truth
then&mdash;when he said that it had been found where the
vestal virgins used to be buried alive. What a curious
coincidence! Now I was called upon to sell it again to
pay for masses for the poor disembodied spirit, and as a
condition of being set free myself from this dungeon. I
was loth to part with the ring I had paid so highly for,
especially now that such an interesting history was
attached to it. Yet, what will not a man do to save
his life?</p>

<p>"<i>Sic erit</i>," I replied. It shall be done.</p>

<p>"<i>Jamnunc sequere me</i>," said she, beckoning to me
with her pale emaciated finger, which together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
hand and arm was so skinny that it might have belonged
to a skeleton. I followed accordingly, and was led
through many a long corridor, passing many a tomb of
martyred saint, though by a different route to that which
I had taken. My guide walked on before me in silence.
That is to say, she did not converse with me more, but
ever to herself I heard the muttered words "<i>Peccavi!
peccavi!</i>" beating her breast as she went.</p>

<p>As I followed my guide, my ears suddenly caught
the tones of distant chanting.</p>

<p>"<i>Quid sibi volunt cantus isti?</i>" What is the
meaning of that singing?</p>

<p>She answered merely by beckoning me on and
hastening her steps. The singing grew more and more
distinct, and as we approached I noticed a dim gleam of
light ahead. Then, shortly turning a corner, I found
myself suddenly in a little chapel, like, in appearance, to
the rest I had seen, but lighted up with many candles,
and with an altar on which stood a rudely-carved crucifix,
a chalice, etc.</p>

<p>But how shall I describe my horror, consternation,
and disgust on beholding the strange congregation there
assembled? It was easy to see with half an eye that
they were no beings of this world. They were seven, I
think, in number; indeed, the chapel had hardly room
for more, and to my dying day, never can I forget that
horrible sight. One of them, who stood at the altar, and
who seemed to be the priest, had evidently been decapitated.
He stood upright, holding his head under his arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>Another, who was naked with the exception of a
cloth round his loins, was bound to a stake and pierced
full of arrows, <i>a la</i> St. Sebastian. Another, who had
been sawn asunder lengthways, was held together by
pieces of rope. One gentleman, who had been skinned
alive for the holy faith, was a most unsightly object, and
reminded me of those anatomical figures you see in
doctors' shops. Whenever he moved, the working of
his anatomy was most painfully visible, and he wore his
skin over his left arm like an overcoat.</p>

<p>There was another, who had evidently been burnt,
for he was as black as a cinder, and presented a most
woe-begone aspect. A sixth had probably been torn to
pieces by some wild beast, for his flesh bore the print of
talons, and here and there hung in long strips, while a
seventh had been broken on the wheel, and seemed
capable of bending his body into the most impossible
positions.</p>

<p>My blood ran cold at such a spectacle, and turning
to my guide, I asked the meaning of this strange sight.
She informed me that they were all spirits of early Christians
who had suffered martyrdom.</p>

<p>"Then why," I asked, "are they not in Paradise
instead of celebrating mass here in these catacombs?"</p>

<p>The reason she gave me was that they had all been
massacred in their sin, and their spirits not being yet
pure enough to enter the realms of eternal bliss, they
were, like herself, doomed to go through their religious
duties as on earth, until masses should be said for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
their deliverance. This, she told me, was her object in
leading me here&mdash;that I might see the misery of these
wretched spirits, and pray for them. I promised I
would do so, and mass being finished, she introduced
me to the skinned gentleman, whom, she informed me,
was her lover. He bowed, grinned horribly, and offered
me his anatomical hand, after which I had a word with
each of the spirits in turn, and then prepared to take my
departure.</p>

<p>"<i>Ora pro nobis!</i>" they all cried at once.</p>

<p>"<i>Sic erit</i>," I replied, and following my guide once
more, she led me again through many long and dreary
passages, which seemed to me interminable, she walking
rapidly in front, whilst I dragged my jaded limbs considerably
in the rear, led on by no other light than the
luminous halo that enveloped her form, and which
barely lit up the spot on which she stood, all else being
in pitchy darkness. At length I thought I felt the
ground ascending somewhat, and as I proceeded ever
slowly upwards, I fancied that I saw a ray of sunlight
struggling through a fissure in the rocky roof of the
vault. I was not mistaken. The nearer I came, the
larger grew the spot of light, and I now saw clearly that
there was a very considerable opening, amply sufficient
to admit of the body of a very large man passing through
it, but quite overgrown by brambles and rank vegetation,
so as effectively to veil the blue sky from my view.
Even through this screen of rank herbage the light
dazzled my eyes intensely, and it was some minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
before I got sufficiently accustomed to it. The ground
now grew suddenly steeper, till I at length found myself
within a few steps of the fissure. My guide now halted,
and pointing to the opening with her hand, made way
for me to pass on in front.</p>

<p>It would seem that the bright sunbeam as it fell
upon her affected her somewhat, for I noticed that her
form grew less distinct, until the vaporous essence that
assumed her shape disintegrated piecemeal, beginning at
the head, gradually downwards, till she completely
vanished from my presence. Not, however, before I
had time to thank her in her own classical language.</p>

<p>"<i>Pro tuis beneficiis gratias ago.</i>"</p>

<p>To which she barely had time to reply "<i>Vale!</i>"
when she became extinct, and I was left once more
alone.</p>

<p>But now I had hope&mdash;I was free. Another step, and
I should be launched into the outer world again.
Hungry, thirsty, fatigued as I was, I should soon be
able to satisfy my present wants and then&mdash;and then&mdash;with
all my young life before me, what might I not
achieve? My first feeling was one of intense gratitude
towards my Creator, who had saved me from a terrible
and lingering death. It was like being born again. I
advanced towards the opening, and was just about to
move aside the luxuriant growth that alone separated me
from the world without, when methought I heard human
voices outside proceeding from no very long distance
from the aperture. Even a human shadow flitted for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
moment across the opening, obscuring for a second some
of the glowing sunlight.</p>

<p>I was loth to emerge from my hiding place into
the open air in sight of men, as, besides startling
them, I should myself become an object of wonderment
and create a scene I particularly wished to
avoid. So I resolved to pause awhile until they should
presently pass on, when I could emerge alone and unobserved.
In this I was disappointed; they seemed to
have no intention whatever of moving on. There they
sat apparently over their meal, chatting at intervals. It
was impossible but that I should thus overhear some
fragments of their conversation, and what I <i>did</i> hear
made my blood run cold.</p>

<p>"Dost remember, Gaspero," said one, "on our last
sally, when we captured the fat landowner from Montefiascone,
and sent him back to his friends with his nose
and his ears slit because they wouldn't send the ransom
in time?"</p>

<p>"<i>Corpo di Bacco!</i> don't I?" answered another.
"But I'll tell you what, if the 'Cavalli leggeri' get wind
of our whereabouts this time, it will be short shrift for all
of us."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said a third, "haven't we good spies enough
always on the alert to warn us of their approach?"</p>

<p>"True," said the former, "but don't let us talk, or
we shall miss the signal."</p>

<p>Then silence reigned for a brief space, broken now
and again by some casual remark hardly audible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Here was a pretty to do! Had I been rescued from
death by starvation only to stumble upon a nest of
brigands? Oh, the irony of it! I trembled for the loss
of the little gold I had upon me, but more still for the
precious ring upon my finger.</p>

<p>"I must risk nothing," I said to myself, "and bide
here in patience at any cost till they depart."</p>

<p>I dreaded lest the beating of my own heart&mdash;so
audible to myself&mdash;should betray me. Thus a full
hour or more passed away, when on a sudden I heard
a sound like the hooting of an owl in the distance.</p>

<p>"The signal&mdash;the signal!" exclaimed several voices
at once, and up they jumped like one man and took to
their heels with the speed of lightning.</p>

<p>I began to emerge from my cavern, and just managed
to catch a glimpse of some peaked hats, carbines, and
sandalled legs, which soon disappeared for ever from my
view. I was now once more under the clear dome of
Heaven. The sky was absolutely cloudless, the heat
intense. I shaded my eyes with my hand to protect
them from the glare of the hot sun which now shone
mercilessly down upon my bare head, for my hat had
been left far behind me in that subterranean burial place.
I tried to realise my situation. Where was I? I was in
the centre of a very arid plain with blue mountains on
the horizon and lines of ruined aqueducts in the middle
distance. Not a hut within sight. The sun was intolerable,
and I felt ready to faint from hunger and exhaustion.
I gathered some broad green leaves to protect my head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and then looked around me for something to assuage
the pangs of hunger.</p>

<p>I recollected that the brigands had been carousing
close to the opening of my cave, so I returned thither to
inspect the spot. To my intense joy I discovered some
broken victuals. There were sundry crusts of bread,
some cheese parings, a few slices of raw ham, a whole
leg of a chicken, besides other bones not quite bare,
which I devoured ravenously. Also a hard-boiled egg
and half a flask of good wine. All this I put away in
very short time, but I wanted more. It was barely
enough to whet my appetite. However, I felt better,
and could now contemplate my past adventures with
great complacency.</p>

<p>The next question was, in what part of the world
was I? Which course should I steer? North, south,
east, or west. I feared being benighted and losing my
way altogether. I sat down on a clump of ancient ruin
to collect my ideas. Presently I heard faintly in the
distance the peculiar cry of a Roman bullock driver, as
he goaded on his sluggish team. I raised my eyes, and
saw about half-a-mile off one of those drays drawn by
buffaloes and laden with large blocks of white marble
from the mountains for the use of sculptors. I hastened
my steps and hailed the driver.</p>

<p>"<i>Accidentaccio!</i>" cried the man in amazement and
horror at the sight of my bleeding head and general woe-begone
appearance.</p>

<p>"What a sight! <i>Che diavolo!</i>&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>Here followed a string of questions which I felt in
no humour to answer, so I cut him short by asking him
to let me get upon his dray, as I wanted a little sleep,
and that I would remember him as soon as we arrived at
the gates of Rome.</p>

<p>"Certainly, signore," said the man, brightening up,
"and if you would like a covering for your head from
the sun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he produced some sort of light drugget&mdash;there
was no other covering, for the dray was only
constructed to carry marble and not passengers.</p>

<p>So I mounted, and flung myself full length on a large
block of marble, covering my head well up and
endeavouring to sleep. So complete was my state of
utter exhaustion that even my uncomfortable position
and the rough jolting of the cumbersome dray when
its massive wheels encountered some big stone combined
with the constant cry of the driver in my ears as
he goaded on his sluggish brutes of burden, was all insufficient
to prevent nature from taking her proper
course, and I actually slept&mdash;ay, slept like a top, spite
of heat, dust, flies, noise, etc., until towards nightfall I
reached the gates of Rome. The stars shone out with
unusual splendour. I felt considerably refreshed after
my long slumber, so I descended, and remunerating the
driver liberally, entered the eternal city.</p>

<p>My first thought was to hasten off to a hatter's,
where I purchased a hat, and then called upon a
doctor. He was out, so I left my address, leaving word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
for him to call at my hotel in the Piazza di Spagna on
the morrow, at ten in the morning. I then repaired to
my hotel and heard that my friend Rustcoin had been
inquiring for me, and marvelled much at my absence.
I then had a wash and a brush down, changed the
bloodstained handkerchief for a clean one, and ordered
supper in my room.</p>

<p>On the morrow, punctually at ten, the doctor made
his appearance. He examined my wound, prescribed
me a lotion, and then asked how the accident had
occurred. In my youthful simplicity I related my tale
from beginning to end, omitting no detail.</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously, shook his head, and
said that the danger was even more than he thought.
He had no doubt that besides the wound in my head, I
was likewise suffering from sunstroke, which would
account for these hallucinations.</p>

<p>Could anything be more irritating? After all the
trouble I had taken in relating my adventures, even to
the merest details&mdash;to be looked upon either as a madman
or impostor! He admitted that I might possibly
have been to explore the catacombs, that I might have
had a fall which caused the wound in my head,
but as to the apparition of the vestal virgin and her unsightly
friends, he would have none of it, admitting that
he was deaf upon principle to all tales of the supernatural,
because they were impossible. Adding that he
was very much surprised to find a young man of education
like myself&mdash;and moreover an Englishman&mdash;still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
believing in such antiquated superstitions. He took his
leave and said he would call the next day.</p>

<p>He came and found me quite convalescent, so soon
took his departure with a shrug, finding that I still
believed in the actuality of my vision. As I was leaving
my hotel for a stroll I ran up against Rustcoin, who was
about to call upon me. You can imagine, my friends,
his wonder on hearing me recount my adventures.</p>

<p>There is little more left to relate. I proceeded in
company with my friend to several shops to endeavour
to sell the ring, but at none of them would they give me
back the sum I gave for it, or anything like it, so I
resolved upon keeping the ring and paying the monks
what I had paid for it, which amounted to the same
thing. So if my spirit friends are not by this time in
Paradise, it is no fault of mine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Here is the ring, gentlemen," said Mr. Oldstone at
the conclusion of his narrative, taking the precious relic
from his forefinger and passing it round for inspection.
"You will observe it is a most exquisite specimen of
Gr&aelig;co-Roman art of the very best period, and believe
me, gentlemen, when I assure you that the wealth of
the universe wouldn't purchase it."</p>

<p>Loud were the expressions of admiration that passed
round the table at the beauty of this antique gem, as
well as the delight and satisfaction of our antiquary's
story.</p>
